@@12747081 @1347081/ <h> Plural Possessives : Why You Put an Apostrophe After the S <p> Its common for people to wonder , " What does it mean to put an apostrophe after an S ? " It can get a bit confusing . To get it right , you need to understand what a possessive is . <p> Possessives are used to show ownership ; to show that something belongs to someone . " The presidents official airplane " is one example . The airplane belongs to the president , of course . But there is only one president ; after all , you do n't  have two presidents of the same country . So , this is a singular possessive made by adding an apostrophe and an " s . " <p> But with a phrase such as " the thieves jewels , " you have a plural noun : thieves . Most of the time , a plural noun will be formed by adding " s " to it . In this case , you also change the spelling but do n't  worry about that now . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Houses , cats , clouds , essays , rainbows : these are all plural nouns . <p> As you can see , the fact that the thieves ( illegally ) possess the jewels is shown simply by adding an apostrophe after the noun and after the letter " s . " They may not possess these valuables for long unless they 're clever and know how to escape the police , but they do for now . And that 's how you form a plural possessive . <p> To recap , usually if the noun is singular , the apostrophe will go before the s , but if the noun happens to be plural , the apostrophe will go after the s . <h> Plural Possessive Examples <p> The Simpsons spaceship ( the spaceship belongs to the Simpson family ; you make the family name plural to show that you 're referring to all of the family members ) <p> The dogs tails ( the tails belong to the dogs ) <p> The lakes water ( the water belongs to the lakes ) <p> You have to be careful with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lake , you must write : " the lakes water . " In this case , that 's a singular possessive . <p> An even bigger problem these days is when people write sentences such as this : " None of the monkeys looked happy in the zoo . " There is no reason to use an apostrophe to make a possessive here . The sentence is only talking about monkeys in the plural . They do not own anything ! However , this is a commonly repeated mistake across the Internet . <p> Sometimes its hard to see how the possessive works . " You owe me three months pay immediately ! " Oh , I do ? Let me check my wallet . And my grammar guide . Why is there an apostrophe after " months ? " Because the pay is equal to three months of work . In a sense , the pay belongs to those three months . Its like saying " three months of pay . " If you can use the word " of " in the sentence , then you probably need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 've learned all the rules , you 're in for a surprise . There 's another type of plural possessive : the irregular plural possessive . The childrens work was so poorly done that the teacher fainted and had to go to the hospital . Okay , this might not really happen , but I used to be a teacher , and sometimes I felt like fainting ! <p> The main point is this . " Children " is already plural . You can not add " s " to the word itself to make it plural . So when you want to show possession , you put the apostrophe first , then the " s . " Here are some more examples . <p> The womens babies ( " women " is the plural form of " woman " ) <p> The firemens trucks ( " firemen " is the plural of " fireman " ) <p> The dices roll ( " dice " always means there is more than one ) <p> These look like singular possessives , but they are n't  . <h> Compound Plural Possessives <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural possessives , but there 's one more rule you need to know . It deals with compound plural possessives . For example , " Sam and Dave " is a compound . There are two parts . So which of the following is correct ? <p> Sam and Daves song was number one for six months . <p> Sams and Daves song was number one for six months . <p> The correct one is the first . Why ? Because Sam and Dave made or performed the song together . It belongs to both of them . Only one possessive needs to be given . But you need to be careful . <p> Lucys and Ginas cars are the fastest on my street . <p> Micks and Rods views on equal rights are impressive . <p> In these two examples , you need two possessives , one for each proper noun . Lucy and Gina both have different cars . Mick and Rod have separate views . However , what if Lucy and Gina were mother and daughter , and both of them had the same cars ? Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars are the fastest on my street . " <p> With compound plural possessives , its important to remember you have to think a little and decide whether you are talking about two separate people or things , or a single unit with two parts . <h> 4 comments <p> Hey , my name is Heiko . I came here because I did n't  know what plural possessive meant when reading it in my grammar book . Its good that there is a clear explanation like this to help people like me . Thank you ! <p> This has always been quite confusing for me . Especially when the word already ends in an " s " I never know what to do with it . It even gets worse when words and in two " ss " I think that there should be a better way to indicate possessive than with an apostrophe since that 's used for conjunctions .

@@12747083 @1347083/ <h> How Many Words in a Novel Chapter ? <p> You 're writing your first novel , and you know you must shoot for around 80 to 95 thousand words . Once you know what your book will be about , its time to start planning the structure of the story . What will happen in each chapter , and how much has to happen before you move on to the next chapter ? How many chapters will you need before you reach your target word count ? <h> Its Up to You Within Reason <p> Before you decide your average chapter length , its a good idea to think about the purpose behind dividing a book into chapters . Think of it as a TV series or a play . Each chapter will consist of one or more scenes that contribute to the development of the story . <p> Unlike TV series , you are n't  limited to a certain amount of airtime , so some important scenes may require longer chapters . The important thing is to end each chapter at the end of a scene , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another time . <p> However , it does n't  make much sense to have one chapter that takes up a major part of the book while other chapters are much shorter . Admittedly , some published authors have done just that , but your readers may find it a little odd . <p> Your audience may also play a role . For example , books for the youth market often have shorter chapters than those intended for adult readers . Again , it is n't a rule , but if you 're writing for people with a short attention span , shorter chapters make sense . <h> How Long Are the Chapters in Books by Famous Authors ? <p> Looking at what successful authors have done in the past is always a help . That 's why writers should always be readers too . Best-selling books show us what the public likes , and of course , were hoping that our own novels will be liked by the public . Let 's look at some chapter lengths , but remember that these are averages . In any of these books , some chapters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone has an average of 4,560 words per chapter . <p> Twilight uses about 4,580 words per chapter . <p> The Hunger Games uses 3,700-word chapters , dividing each chapter into three parts . <h> What Do Most Writers See as a Good Average Chapter Length ? <p> The debate is ongoing . Some will tell you 2,500 words is the average , while others will say that 3,000 to 5,000 word chapters are more likely to be the norm . Most agree that under 1,000 words would be rather short and that over 5,000 might be rather too long . As a general guideline , chapters should be between 3,000 to 5,000 words . <p> All of them agree that the chapter length should be defined by the story and that any chapter length targets you decide on are merely guidelines . Most of them say that trying to keep the chapters within a certain length range is helpful to the reader . <h> Chapter Length Rule 1 : There Are No Rules <p> Writers sometimes use extra-short chapters such as ones that are a sentence or two long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter that consists of a sentence , or even just a word , will make readers sit up and take note . However , use this technique sparingly . It loses its effect if you regularly do it . <p> There 's also no real rule that says a chapter ca n't be longer than 5,000 words . Daniel Defoe wrote the book Moll Flanders without dividing it into chapters at all , so in theory , you could say that the entire book consisted of just one chapter . However , as a new author , I 'm not sure you would get away with that . <h> Its the Story That Matters Most <p> Trying to pad out an uneventful chapter with thoughts or events that do n't  contribute to your plot will bore your readers leaving them with the impression you 're waffling . Compressing a very exciting scene so you can meet your chapter word count target is also not going to do you any favors . <p> While the idea of chapters in the 3,000 to 5,000-word range is a good guideline when roughing out your books structure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the primary deciding factor . Build your plot through a series of events or scenes . Then decide for yourself where the chapter divisions will be . You may decide to include two or more scenes in a chapter , or you might stick to one scene per chapter . Just ensure that the division comes at a time when a reader could put the book down if they want a break . Of course , if you keep it exciting enough , your reader will want to know what will happen next , and might have trouble putting the book down at all . <h> 2 comments <p> I 'm writing a novella and finding myself making the chapters really short . Pretty much each chapter is a single scene , and runs from roughly 1000-1800 words , but not over . I was planning to have fewer , longer chapters , but as I started writing , I settled on these shorter ones . And yet , I like the way it feels and I think the scenes are distinct enough in most places to warrant it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . But I worry that one or two of the later chapters will be much longer , maybe even 2500 or 3000 words . Is this going to be a problem for readers , both the short chapters in general and the few that are longer than the rest ? 
@@12747084 @1347084/ <h> Tens of Thousands <p> Vague numbers like tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands and tens of millions are not scientific . They can be used as a sheer exaggeration , or they could reflect a vague number that 's based on fact . Of course , you could always ask people to clarify what they really mean , or look up the real facts for yourself , but here are a few guidelines when you do use or come across numbers like this . <h> Exaggeration <p> When it comes to exaggeration , anything goes as long as the number is far from representing any reality . Its usually fairly obvious when someone is doing this because what they are saying is frankly impossible , or at least , unlikely . What they really mean is " a lot . " Although " thousands " and " millions " are more frequently used in exaggeration than " tens of thousands " or " hundreds of thousands , " there 's nothing to stop people from getting creative when indulging in the art of exaggeration ! <h> Vague Real Numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The word " tens " is pluralized , so just 10,000 would be too few . You need several sets of ten to make up " tens . " We have now successfully eliminated all numbers from 10,000 to 19,999 . As soon as we hit the 20,000 mark , we now have more than one set of ten , so we can use the plural form . This holds true all the way up to 99,999 , although , by the time you get to the upper limit " almost a hundred thousand , " though still vague , gives a better indication of just how big the numbers are . <h> Vague Hundreds of Thousands <p> Now that we 've looked at " tens of thousands , " you could probably write this paragraph for me , but in case I lost you first time round , let 's take it from the top . " Hundreds " means more than one set of a hundred , so you cant speak of hundreds of thousands of anything without exaggerating until you get to the two hundred thousand level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the number under discussion reaches one million , but most people would point out that anything over 900,000 is getting close to a million . <h> Why Be Vague About Numbers ? <p> There are actually several reasons to be unclear about numbers : <p> You do n't  know what the number is , and you 're guessing . <p> You have some idea of the number , but there could be more or less than that . <p> You 're using these expressions for effect and know you may be exaggerating . <p> You are n't  exaggerating , but you either do n't  have , or couldnt be bothered with , exact numbers . <p> The exact numbers are n't  really important . <h> How About Some Examples ? <p> People have been making fires using this method for hundreds of thousands of years . <p> Modern humans are said to have evolved about 200,000 years ago , so its not incorrect to use " hundreds of thousands . " Besides , the exact number here is n't really important . What you are saying is that people have used a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . <p> Again , the exact number really is n't an issue in this statement . I just want people to know that they can write a lot of words using a simple challenge . If the person is interested in knowing more after reading this statement , they can look to see the exact number is 66,795 words . <p> There must be hundreds of thousands of bacteria living on that decaying food ! <p> here 's a statement that 's sheer guesswork . You have absolutely no idea how many bacteria are living on the food , but by the look of it , there must be plenty . <p> Judging from the poll , there are tens of thousands of people who agree with me . <p> There was a number . It was big . You cant really remember it , and you ca n't be bothered to get the exact figure . Was it 30,000 , or was it 50,000 ? You 're not really sure . <p> With how many tens of thousands of grains of salt should you take vague number statements ? <p> To put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use vague numbers ? I think the best bet is to believe that they mean " a lot " and judging by the context , you should be able to get some idea of whether their " tens " or " hundreds " of thousands really do fall into the numerical range suggested by the phrases . <p> All the same , you cant take numbers like that too seriously . They 're just too broad , and they can too easily be used to make exaggerated claims . When in doubt , find out . That 's what Google is for . <p> Yes , in a general sense you are correct , but tens of thousands is such a broad amount that they can be quite confusing . There 's a huge difference between 20,000 and 90,000 just like there 's a huge difference between 2 million and 9 million . <p> here 's the issue I have with numbers like this . They do n't  really mean anything . Basically , you 're saying " a really big number " so if you would n't put that in a sentence , then you should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions , hundreds of millions or any other number like that . <p> Saying " there were tens of thousands of people at the game " is no different than saying " there were a really big number of people at the game " <p> I do n't  think this is correct . Sure , its not an exact number , but it gives a general idea of the crowd . There is a mental difference between dozens at the game , hundreds at the game , thousands at the game and tens of thousands at the game . While none of those numbers is specific , you can create an mental image of how many people are at the game with each one , and each will be different .

@@12747087 @1347087/ <h> How Long Does It Take to Write a 1000 Word Essay ? <p> Oh wow ! That 's a tough question . It depends on a whole lot of things . At the same time , you shouldnt be intimidated. 1,000 words is actually a relatively short piece . A dissertation would usually be in the region of 12,000 words , and university assignments can stretch to essays of 5,000 words . No matter what your assigned word count may be , some of the things that will influence the time it takes to write the essay include : <h> How long does it take to research an essay ? <p> If you 're writing an opinion piece on something you already have some knowledge about , you may not have to do any research at all . It may just be a matter of organizing your existing thoughts into a coherent essay . If you need to find out about a topic before you begin to write , you can easily get information on certain topics , whilst others will be more obscure and therefore more difficult to research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the faster you can write . <h> How good are your reading comprehension skills ? <p> Some of us can just skim a piece and pick up all the salient points . Others will have to read with more attention , and even re-read a piece several times to extract the information we need . Having good reading and comprehension skills makes writing much faster since you 're able to " get " the facts faster and organize them better . Now you know why you had to do so many reading comprehension tests at school . <h> How well did you plan ? <p> Throwing yourself headlong at a 1,000-word essay and writing till you reach the word count may seem like the easy option , but it is n't . Planning your essay so that it begins with an introduction , highlights the most important points you want to make and then wraps everything up into a conclusion actually saves you time . Sometimes , essay instructions will tell you how to structure the piece , so read them carefully and extract any information you can use to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Have you ever gotten lost halfway through a sentence ? You know what you wanted to say , but halfway through , the thought slips away from you . The faster you can type , the more easily you can capture thoughts before your mind moves onto the next thing and you forget what you were trying to say . Typing skills are essential in the modern world . Consider using typing games to improve your speed . <h> How long does it take me to write a 1,000-word essay ? <p> Faster is n't always better . The more in-depth your report is meant to be , the longer you should spend on it . I can usually research and write a fairly technical magazine article of 1,000 words in three hours , but do remember that I 'm a professional writer . I 'm fast because I write all day , every day . <p> The longest Ive ever spent on a 1,000-word article was 12 hours . It was absolutely brutal ! The information I needed to gather was very technical , hard to find , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you really understand the subject matter . I also had to contact experts for their opinions , but I could n't even ask about their opinions until I could target them with the right questions . As a result , I actually had to write most of the article before slotting in the expert comment . <p> The quickest Ive ever written a 1,000-word article is one hour . In this case , I already knew the subject matter well and did n't  have to back up every fact in the essay with references . <h> Reviewing your work also matters <p> If you 're writing for grades and want a good one , you need a really good essay . Do n't  start writing it the day before you have to hand it in . Try and get your first draft down at least a day or two before you have to submit your work . Then return to it and do your editing . Read your essay aloud to yourself , since this will help you pick up any careless errors you would n't otherwise spot . Check to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next and make sure that you 've presented your information clearly . <p> Remember , teachers get tired . They have to read the same kind of essay over and over again when they grade . If they struggle to understand what you 're saying , you might not get as good a grade as you would if you stuck to using short sentences and relatively simple language . <p> Your reviewing process shouldnt take all that long . If you do n't  have to make a lot of changes , you should be able to do your final edit in under half an hour . <p> Take your time . Whatever you do , do n't  rush . You might want your essay to be written quickly , but if its an important essay , taking your time will give you a better finished product . Budget your time conservatively . Its better to find that you 've still got time left over than to run out of time and end up dashing things off with a looming deadline . <p> Below are some basic guidelines if you need a rough estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You should change the times you have listed to reflect how long it actually takes to write . Obviously you do n't  know since the mes you listed are not the same as what I can do ! <p> Did you even read the article ? The writer says that its based on what she writes and is just a general approximation . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essay will obviously be different because you 're not the same as everybody else . Nobody writes at the same speed so how long it takes you to write an essay will be different for every person . <p> If you already have all the research done and know what you want to say , then a 1000 word essay shouldnt take more than an hour to write . In fact , it probably can be done in 30 minutes or less . The time-consuming part of an essay is the research and how long that takes depends on how much you have to do . But the actual writing of the essay shouldnt take too long at all . <p> But research is part of the writing process . If a person writes a book , they do n't  only count the time it took them at the typewriter writing . They count all the time it took to research the book as well . Trying to separate the two does n't  make sense . <p> I think an important thing to point out here is that there 's a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good 1000 word essay . You can write an essay in hardly any time at all if you do n't  do the proper research and do n't  spend time editing what you wrote . If you 're going to write a good essay , its going to take more time . You should always give yourself more time than you think you 're going to need to get it done . <p> This applies to all writing . Writing and writing something something well will have a huge time discrepancy even if both writings are the same length . Just because you are able to finish something quickly does n't  mean that 's the best way to do it . <p> In my opinion , hours that are presented here a partially true . It may take about an hor to write 300 word essay but editing also takes some time . So on averege , I count the time to write the piece itself + time edit everything . <p> It takes way too long ! Teachers should not be allowed to assign essays more than 250 words . They always complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its only because they make their students do too much work ! ! <p> This comment just makes you look lazy . 250 words is nothing . Any topic that needs to be explored will take many more words than this . If you do n't  want to write , just admit it and do n't  try to project that on others . <p> This is so arbitrary and will depend on the individual . Its like asking the question , " how long does it take to write a book ? " For some , it will only take a couple of months while for others it will take a lifetime . it also depends on the type of writing you 're doing . Some writing is easy and quick and other writing is difficult and requires huge amounts of research . 
@@12747088 @1347088/ <h> How Many Paragraphs in an Essay ? <p> There is no firm rule that says an essay needs to have a set number of paragraphs , but an essay must be a minimum of three paragraphs . There are a lot of people who say an essay should be five paragraphs , but its an extremely limiting rule , and unless you 've been instructed to write a five paragraph essay , there 's no reason to stick to it . <p> As a rule , you 'll write your essay in three main parts . First , you 'll introduce your topic to your reader . Next , you will have body text in which you discuss the topic in more detail , and finally , you 'll have a conclusion that tells your reader what you were able to see after looking into the facts or thinking through the topic . <p> In its simplest form , an essay can consist of three paragraphs with one paragraph being devoted to each section . Proponents of the five paragraph essay say that the body text should consist of three paragraphs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs in this section . <h> Guessing How Many Paragraphs Before You Begin <p> This is a rule of thumb , which means it wont always work quite that way , but its handy all the same . In academic work , your paragraphs are likely to be a bit longer than most of the ones you see in this blog post . On average , there are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph . So if you 'd like a guesstimate , you can assume that a 1,000-word essay will have between five and ten paragraphs . <h> What Points Do You Have to Cover ? <p> Another , less limiting and more accurate way to work out how many paragraphs you need to cover your topic is to look at the main points you have to cover in the body text . A paragraph contains all the ideas that support or explain a single concept . <p> When you are planning your essay , you will think of or research the main elements that are needed in the body text . It would be safe to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , if there is a lot of information to cover in order to explore each area , you may need more . <p> For example , if you are writing an essay on childhood development and exposure to technology , you will want to look into the physical , psychological and cognitive developmental effects of tech on kids . When you research this topic , you will find that there are contrasting points of view and researchers have identified several physical , developmental , and psychological effects of technology use in children . <p> Assuming five psychological effects have been identified , you can assume you 'll need to write five paragraphs if you are going to write a relatively in-depth essay . But if both those who say technology is bad for kids and those who say it can be good have done a great deal of work on the sub-topic , you might want to make that ten paragraphs so that you can cover both sides of the argument and look into how earlier authors reached their conclusions . <p> Of course , if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to go in-depth at all , in which case a paragraph for each of the main sub-topics ( psychology , physical development , and cognitive development ) will likely be adequate . <h> Essay Content Is More Important Than the Number of Paragraphs <p> Ultimately , your essay will be evaluated on the information you present , not on the number of paragraphs in the essay . Early in your academic life , teachers and lecturers may give you both a structure for your essay and a guideline on how long each part of the essay should be . I have seen essay instructions say how many marks are allocated for each section , and my trick is to take the total word count and allocate a percentage of words to each section based on the percentage of marks you can get for it . After all , if the teacher is allocating 80 marks for content in total and you can see 50% of the mark relates to a certain part of the essay , then 50% of your essays words should be devoted to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic and told to air your opinion . This gives you more freedom , but its a tad more difficult . The research will show you how many angles you should look at , and itll help you to find information that both supports and contradicts your point of view . To make a strong argument , you need to look at both supporting and contradictory information . <p> To avoid getting tangled up in one aspect of the discussion , you 'll have to decide how long it should be . If its the most important aspect informing your conclusion , you can spend a little more time ( and words ) on that particular point . It could run into several paragraphs rather than just one or two . <h> Always Remember the Purpose of Paragraphs <p> Paragraphs structure information into sub-topics , and they make your work easier to read and understand thanks to the structure they provide . With careful advance planning , you 'll be able to work out more or less how many paragraphs you need to complete your essay . <h> How many paragraphs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some estimates on the number of paragraphs there would be in an essay of different lengths based on an average length of 150 words per paragraph . Of course , the number of paragraphs for your essay will depend on many different factors . You can use the following information for a general reference , but do n't  take these numbers as literal .. <h> 7 comments <p> I do n't  understand , How can a 100 , 200 , 300 and 400 word essay all have 3 paragraphs if a paragraph is 100 to 200 words long ? A 100 word essay should be 1 paragraph or 1/2 a paragraph , not 3 paragraphs . Can someone explain this too me ? <p> A sentence is an idea . A paragraph is a group of ideas that relate to one another . That 's the most important point . The second most important one is remembering that your text consists of introduction , body , conclusion with at LEAST one paragraph for each . While teachers like 100 to 200 word paragraphs , you cant always apply that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the five paragraphs for an essay is more of a rule-of-thumb number that is easy to teach students when they are first learning to write . Your teacher was just trying to make sure you understood how to write , not give you a rule you had to always obey . <p> I think five paragraphs is a good number to shoot for when writing , but it is n't a hard-fast rule you need to hit every time . Each essay is different and require more or less paragraphs depending on the information you need to provide in the writing . <p> I was taught essays should be 7 paragraphs long , not 5 . My teacher said 3 central paragraphs never gives enough detail to the topic , so we should write 5 . It makes sense to me and that is how Ive always done it . <p> What you 're taught is often a general rule to shoot for , not a rule set in concrete . That 's the case with this . Your teacher felt that 7 paragraphs was a good number for the essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be that way . its a general rule , not a concrete one .

@@12747092 @1347092/ <p> Talk about opening a can of worms ! I initially though the answer to the question of the difference between " I look forward to hearing from you " and " I am looking forward to hearing from you " would be they 're interchangeable since both are absolutely correct English . A look around the Internet , however , tells me this minor difference in sentence structure causes quite a bit of controversy . Some say one is informal while the other is formal . Then there are others who say that actually , they see it the other way round and that the one that was declared " informal " is actually the one they consider " formal . " <h> Should This Bother You ? <p> Probably not . Nobody is going to brand you as illiterate because you choose one of these forms over the other as they both say basically the same thing . But if were going to enter the formal versus informal debate , I 'd side with those who say " I look forward to hearing from you " is the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority and therefore the winning side ! <p> here 's why : if- you say " I am looking forward to hearing from you , " you have n't quite got the " balls in your court " message across strongly enough . Somehow , it seems to me , " I look forward to hearing from you " is a tiny bit clearer about who has to say something next . The former has a slightly greater nuance pointing towards how pleasant it would be to hear from someone , while the other is sharper , and the focus seems to be on the response you 're looking forward to getting . <p> Of course , that 's just my opinion . Authorities seem to disagree to disagree , and actually get quite heated arguing for one or the other . <h> Do Apostrophes Make Everything More Friendly ? <p> There are those who say " I am looking forward to hearing from you , " is still formal , whereas using the apostrophe to make " I am " contract into " I 'm " is the informal way of expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I expect most people will be ready to agree that contractions like " I 'm " are more informal than the full versions of the words . Again , I cant argue against the reasoning behind this argument while still believing that the " I am " version places more emphasis on " looking forward . " <h> Getting It All Mixed-Up <p> Since these phrases are so similar in their meaning , some people mix up the tenses : " I am looking forward to hear from you , " is a common error . As soon as " look " gets an " ing " suffix , the next verb has to have an " ing " too . Thank goodness it does . English is confusing enough without mixing things up . <h> Nobody Can Quite Put a Finger on It <p> After browsing numerous articles , forums and other interesting places on the Internet , I came to this conclusion : most people agree that " I look forward to hearing " is more formal and urgent than " I am looking forward to hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since there does n't  appear to be a definite answer to this question , what 's your opinion on it ? More specifically , why do you feel this way ? Let us know your reasons you feel one is more formal than the other . <h> 12 comments <p> Are n't  these two the exact same thing ? Why would anyone get worked up about two sentences which are essentially saying he same thing ? I think people have way too much time on their hands if this is something they eel needs to be argued about . <p> I have to agree . It seems to be splitting hairs over something that is n't all that important . I guess its all your writing is perfect then you might want to obsess on this , but there are so many more common mistakes which are much more egregious that this simply seems like a waste of time to worry about . <p> It amazes me what people will argue and get worked up about on the Internet . These may not be exactly the same , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the person who receives the memo is n't going to notice you used one and not the other . <p> I do n't  see a difference in the two phrases . They both mean the same thing . People get all worked up about things like this while there are real tragedies in the world . I think we all need to rethink our priorities . <p> While phrasing words in different ways can ultimately mean the same thing , I do n't  see it as the case in this situation . The difference is n't large , but there is a subtle difference implied between the two . " I look forward " seems to be more of a demand at a response while " I am looking forward " is more of a hope .

By the time you reach the age of four , you already know 10,000 words .

I know because I counted them especially for you . Alright , I did n't  . I looked that up . <p> According to the same source , a further 47,156 words have become obsolete or archaic . What happened to them ? People stopped using them so they became extinct . When we stop using words , they just die out of the language , and you have to admit that the mass-extinction of words is rather a sad thing . <p> That 's why we have National Word Day .

@@12747094 @1347094/ <h> When to use was versus were <p> English can be difficult , especially when it comes to words that can be easily confused . A couple of examples would be who vs whom and further vs farther . Another combo that can get confusing is was vs were . <p> There are several reasons why you might be struggling to decide whether you should be using " was " or " were " in a sentence . The simplest of these is the conjugation of the singular and plural forms of the past tense of " to be . " While this can cause minor problems to those learning English as a second language as they study , first language English speakers usually have few problems with this . The most common cause of debate and confusion is the use of " were " instead of " was " in the subjunctive mood ( Well explain that below if you are n't  sure what subjunctive mood is . ) . Well cover both past and subjunctive mood topics in this article , and you 'll soon see just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we 've observed , this is the easiest of the choices you need to make , but it also gives rise to the problems that so many people have when they begin to use the subjunctive mood . <p> Singular : I was , he was , she was , it was BUT you were . ( Just to make things more fun ! ) <p> Plural : Its always were , regardless of whether were talking about " they , " " we " or " you . " So far , so easy ! But now well examine how this relates to one of the most common errors in spoken or written English : the choice of " was " instead of " were " in the subjunctive mood . <h> If I were / was a rich man the famous subjunctive mood <p> The subjunctive mood is used to describe or speculate on a hypothetical situation , and you 'll hear people using both " was " and " were " in this context . But only one of these is correct . Whenever were talking about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was " and choose " were " instead . It does n't  matter whether we are referring to a single person or a group of people . As soon as we cross the border between reality and speculation , " were " is the only word to choose . For example <p> I was rich and I owned a house at the seaside . <p> If I were rich , I would have owned a house at the seaside . <p> He was the captain of the team and he chose a different strategy . <p> If he were captain of the team , he would have chosen a different strategy . <p> In each of the pairs of sentences above , the first one refers to something that actually happened in the past , and the word " was " is the correct choice . The second sentence is a wish or a speculation it refers to an event that did not actually happen , and " were " is the correct choice . <p> They were the winning team , so they celebrated their victory . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their victory . <p> As we can see , the subjunctive mood does n't  result in any change in word choice in this example . No matter how many people you are referring to , the subjunctive mood calls for the word " were . " If you 've been prone to saying the incorrect " I wish I was , " " If he was " or " I wish she was " instead of the correct I wish I were , " " If he were " or " I wish she were , " it will be easy to make the necessary adaptation and correct your grammar . <p> Look out for the subjunctive mood . As soon as something is a wish or a hypothetical ( if ) situation , you will always choose " were " over " was . " <p> Its a common grammar mistake . In spoken as well as written English , you 'll find that just about everyone from plumbers to presidents is guilty of this mistake . Of course , when presidents make this error , those who know better will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say will be taken seriously , its worth learning when to use " were " instead of " was . " After all , once you understand the basic rules , its quite easy . <p> This sure helps a lot to understand the difference even though it still sounds a bit wrong when saying it out loud . At least now I know how to use it correctly . At least I think I do enough to finally get some sleep <p> It is easy for me to understand why this would be confusing to a large number of people . I really do n't  know the rules well , so I always play it by ear . If it sounds correct , then I 'm usually right . I could n't decide whether to use " was " or " were " and that 's how I ended up at this article . It can get a bit confusing , but I understand the correct way to use both now . Thank you . <p> Thank you for this simple explanation between the difference of was and were . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question into the search engine . I think I have a better understanding of when to use the word " was " and when to use the word " were " now that I 've read this . <p> Does it really matter ? If a person understands what you mean to say , who cares if you use was or were ? People are far too uptight about grammar and shouldnt care as long as everyone understands . This is a big overreaction to make something more complicated than it should be the only people who care are teachers so they can keep their jobs . <p> It does matter , In fact , it matters a lot . I can write , " I enjy brekfast evryday " which you can probably figure out what I mean to say , but it looks terrible . There really is no difference when using " was " and " were " incorrectly . You really should care about grammar for exactly this reason . <p> This seems like a lazy excuse not to use proper grammar or not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be judged by how you speak and write . Knowing the correct way to use verbs like was and were is important for this reason . <p> I was going to go out tonight to have a lot of fun . If I were to go out tonight , I think I would have a lot of fun . <p> I do n't  understand why in these two sentences I use " was " for one of them and " were " for the other when they are both basically saying the exact same thing . Can someone explain this to me so it makes sense ? <p> This is a great way to explain the two words . was and were are difficult . So many get it wrong I know because I am one of them . This helped a lot thank you for the post and also for the great explanation . <p> I understand the whole first person etc .. , but when it comes to objects , what are the rules . For example : The man said the set of tires were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of tires was returned . Is it was because its a set or is it were because they 're tires ? <p> Is it safe to say that if the sentence starts with " If I " then it will always be " were " that comes next and not " was " ? I 'm just trying to make sure that I understand the difference between these two words correctly so I do n't  make any mistakes . <p> If you are speculating , which you are in a " what if " sentence , then you use " were " and not " was " Was is used for the past tense . So , yes , you would be correct to use " were " when speculating with " if I " <p> This s the sentence in its entirety I think its were please let me know .

There 's just one problem : its really hard to spot mistakes you made yourself . You might think some commercial editing software can help you , and although I 'll admit some of these are pretty good at picking up certain errors , none of them will find them all . You can believe me . I 've tried a lot of them with hope in my heart . To test them , I feed them work I know is packed with errors , and I still have n't found one able to find all of them . I guess this leads me to my first piece of advice : <h> Never Trust Editing Software <p> Its actually quite comforting to know there are some things a machine ca n't do effectively : writing is one of them , editing is another . Do n't  rely on spell checkers , grammar checkers or any other writing programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and your brain will never be made redundant by a machine . The Matrix needs us . <h> Let It Lie for a While <p> The worst possible time to try and edit something you 've written is right after you write it . I find the greater the distance in time between me and my written work , the more effectively I 'm able to edit it . Its as if it becomes someone elses work . I can read it impartially and with fresh eyes , picking out mistakes I previously missed . 24 hours is the absolute minimum , and 48 hours is even better . Do I practice what I preach ? Ahem <h> Read It Aloud <p> Yes , I know it feels dorky . Just pretend you 're a TV news reader or the narrator for a documentary . Put on your best " announcer " voice and read it as if it were a script . You can also have a program read it to you with the Word Counter proofread feature . ( If you do n't  see it above the text area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons " ) Does anything make you falter ? Are there sentences that sound weird ? Did you need to pause at a place where there was no punctuation mark ? These are areas that probably need tweaking , even if you cant actually put your finger on the reason why they 're wrong . <h> Trust Your Instincts <p> It gets harder when you 're editing someone elses work . You do n't  want to offend them by making unnecessary changes . Sometimes , things are said in a way you would n't have done it . Is it wrong ? Maybe not , but I 'd still advise an adjustment . When I edit , I cant always say exactly why I changed this or that sentence , but in time , I 've learned that my instincts are often right . Its better to make an unnecessary change than to skip a change just because you are n't  sure how to explain it . <h> Track Changes <p> When editing another persons work , track changes so they can decide if they want to accept your judgment or not . Then create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes tracked " one ) , and check again . I often find I pick up additional errors . Do n't  ask me why . Maybe one does n't  see everything the first time around . With your own work , there 's no need to track changes , but the final proofread rule still applies . <h> Look out for Ambiguity <p> You can be ambiguous without actually making a grammatical error . You know what you meant . Did you say what you meant ? Imagine you know nothing about the topic and are reading about it for the first time . Does it make sense ? <h> Pay Extra Attention to Long Sentences <p> The longer the sentence , the more likely itll contain an error . Have you put a comma where a period- would be better ? Is your thought presented in a crisp , clear way , or have you become tangled up in your own words ? <h> Does Everything You Have Written Contribute ? <p> When writing an essay , you 're trying to get a point across . Anything that does n't  actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , there has to be a reason for everything you have said . You could be contributing to the atmosphere or providing background , but if what you 've said does not contribute something , its just padding that waters down your prose . <h> Beware of Punctuation <p> Its worth studying how to use punctuation marks . Commas , semi-colons , colons and dashes are often used incorrectly . Have you used them correctly ? When in doubt , check . If you 're still not sure , rephrase . <h> Know Your Vices <p> When editing your own work , its good to know what mistakes you commonly make . Since you probably make them without even realizing it , have someone who knows their stuff give some of your writing a look over to point them out . Ask questions and learn to identify your slips . You 'll probably find your slips a few times before the lesson sinks in. <h> 2 comments <p> Editing is the under-appreciated skill in writing .

The choice between writing a letter and typing a letter is influenced by the reason for writing , so well look at business letters and friendly letters and argue the pros and cons of writing or typing under these categories . <h> Write or Type Business Letters <p> If you want to be taken seriously in this day and age , you would certainly choose to type rather than write when sending a business letter . The only part of a business letter you should write by hand is the signature . Here are some of the reasons its appropriate to type rather than write a business letter . <p> Your handwriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You cant as easily make changes to a handwritten business letter , so even if you draft it several times , you may not express yourself as well when you write by hand . <p> A typed letter looks neater and more professional , no matter how neat your handwriting is . <p> Spell check can save you from embarrassment . Yes ! I spelled " embarrassment " correctly the first time ! Can you ? <p> In the business world , handwritten letters are extremely rare , but there is one place other than the signature where I feel handwriting offers a special touch .

I think most people would acknowledge that you went to extra effort on their behalf with a handwritten personal letter . What 's more , any errors that sneak in will be forgiven because you 're presumably writing to someone who is close to you . They like you , even love you , and its probably not for your skill at spelling . <p> Before you decide to give a personal letter a special touch by writing it with old-fashioned pen and paper , know what you 're letting yourself in for . <p> You need to plan ahead by creating a rough framework so that your thoughts flow logically . <p> Youll have to write at least two versions and possibly more . <p> You need to be able to write neatly so that its easily readable . <p> You need the right equipment . <p> Choose attractive note paper , and if you struggle to keep your lines straight on paper without lines , choose paper with ruled lines . Another option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a sheet with ruled lines when you place it beneath the page you are working with . Choose a pen with ink that wo n't easily smudge , and pick a dark colored ink . Gold may look pretty , but it is n't easy to read a full letter written in gold pen . Black ink is best . <h> Additional Advantages of Typed Personal Letters <p> One thing you should remember about handwritten letters is that you 'll get less text on each page . If you have a lot to say in your letter , typing is probably a better solution . You do n't  want to end up trying to cram a ten-page missive into an envelope . <p> If you 're planning to write to several people , you can " cheat " just a little bit .

The problem is there are hundreds of different translations of the Bible , and each one has a different number of words , so the answer depends on which bible you 're actually referring to . That being said , if you are looking for a general answer , its probably best to use one of the most common versions , such as the King James Bible . <h> How many words are there in the Bible ? <p> The King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . How many words is that ? If you can type at 60 words a minute , it would take you just over 217 and a half hours to retype the entire Bible . Can you imagine how long type-setting must have taken in the early days of printing ? <p> As for the number of letter characters in the Bible , the total count is a staggering 3,116,480 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of printing errors were made .

The Catholic Bible has an even higher word count because it has seven books more than the protestant Bible . Are you wondering why ? <p> Martin Luther felt that seven of the books accepted as part of the Old Testament at the time were not quite up to scratch since the 90 AD Jewish Council of Jamnia had rejected them . Luther reasoned that the Old Testament was Jewish , and , therefore , shouldnt include anything that Jews did n't  accept . <h> Chapters and verses : finding your way around <p> There are 66 books in the Bible , and before the 12th century , they werent divided into chapters .

How many people named " Mark " or " John " do you know ? Now think of all the " Marys " you 've met in your time . Of course , some names have fallen out of grace for good reasons .

If you were to flip through your Bible counting question marks , youd find 3,294 , but now that I 've told you how many there are , you can save yourself the trouble . <p> The Bible has one Central Character , who is referred to as " God " 4,094 times and as " Lord " 6,781 times . <p> Looking for the longest book in the Bible ? Look no further than Psalms , a book that also includes the longest chapter in the Bible : Psalm 119 , which has more words than any other chapter . For those who are looking for a lot of information in a very short book , 3 John is recommended reading ; it has the lowest word count of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this in the first place ? <p> Christians believe that the Bible was inspired by God , but if you would like to find out how many human authors were involved , you will find that there is some debate as to who actually wrote what . In general , authorities believe that the Bible was written by 80 authors . <h> How many copies of the Bible have been printed ? <p> Nobody really knows the answer to this question , but the Bible Society estimates that since 1812 , over 5 billion Bibles have been printed . Other experts differ , but one thing is for certain , saying that " a lot " of bibles have been printed over the years would be an understatement . <p> Would you like to guess which country prints the most bibles ? China comes in at number 1 . There 's only one publishing house that 's allowed to print them , and in 2012 , its 100 millionth Bible rolled off the presses . <h> A remarkable book <p> No other book in history has been as influential as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical matters that rage today . Whatever your opinions , one thing is absolutely certain : the King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> Because its a translation . = The original books were written in Hebrew and Greek ; so , its been translated differently to meet different needs . Some are word for word translations and some are phrase by phrase and some are a paraphrase . You should be mindful of how your Bible is translated . I do n't  know any Hebrew but I know a smidgen of Spanish , so here 's an example : " Tu erres mi amore " = " You are my Love " or " I love you " . Both from what I understand are good translations . One is word for word and one is more of a translation of how we express the same thing in common English . = <p> Well , if someone has translated it then it is no longer the word of God . Its a translation ( someones interpretation of the words meaning in their own language ) of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what God really meant by those words . Just saying <p> The number of words will depend on the language it is written in and the version of the bible you have . Every language has different versions and then also there might be comments so this will be a very hard question to answer . <p> Spoken like a true Christian . Just because someone does n't  believe in your religion does n't  mean your God who supposedly loves everyone is sending them straight to hell . I love you ! Now be tortured for all eternity . How about instead of spreading your prejudice and judgement , you spread compassion , peace and humanity . I think we could use a little more of that these days . <p> Thank you for providing the word count for the bible .

If you would object to these being taught , then you should also object to the Bible being taught as they are one in the same . <p> Lillian , You obviously do n't  know your history or what 's going on now for that matter .

The trouble with teaching Islam or other religions is they can and have been proven not from God . The Christian bible is the only bible that has not been proven wrong or destroyed . It can not be destroyed because God said it would be here until the end of time . It is the only book that tells us where we came from and where we are going and how to get there . No other book comes close to answering all the questions of man concerning salvation of our soul . The books of old are never pick up anymore and never tries to teach us how to get to heaven or any where else . Only the bible of the Christians does that . Two options are in the bible . Heaven or hell . My choice . al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the same reasoning to " prove " the existence of any other God .

Please reference the Septuigent ( Greek translation ) as a good it existed in black and white by this date " and see the pinpoint accurate prophecies of the nations that would rise , the directs they would come from , the nature of them , the very day the messiah would come in as king ( about 500 year prediction to the day accurate ) , how the messiah would die , who he would die with , how he would be tried , etc . <p> But none of that will sway anyone , its never evidence that people reject the bible , its because they do n't  want to worship God and admit their need for his free salvation he provided on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian nation , does not mean the government is Christian . It means most people believe in God and the bible way of morals and commands and laws . If you will check the Christian bible , our government was patterned after the form of government the people of God lived under . Now that has to mean something . The majority of people still believe in that form of government . Most people want the same thing the people of God wanted . The bible presents the best form of Government known to man . All else has failed , and Miserably . Why ? They left God and His way of governing . Now if that do n't  mean we are a Christian Nation , then it certainly does n't  mean we are a Devil nation . You have to be one or the other , for there is no other kind of Government . Gods way or the devils way . Which are we ? ? ? You answer that one . I know which we are . But , there are sign we are going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a devils government . It happen in the past and can happen again . Remember the world wide flood . Remember Sodom and them other cities . we can become an anti-God government . Elect more demon-crats and liberals , and we will be that devil government and incur the wrath of the God of Heaven and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . al <p> Wrong . The Bible does NOT teach morality . It teaches judgement and punishment . No child should be subjected to that until they enter the age of reason where they can make their own choices . If we waited to brainwash our children the number of religious people would absolutely plummet to near zero . Also evolution is a proven thing . See , if evolution was NOT proven it would be called the Evolutionary Hypothesis . A theory is something that has been proven to an extent , but we do n't  have all the facts yet , but we have enough to understand that it works on most levels . So let 's not teach our children lies , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament can be found in numbers 1:46 . KJV 603,550. counting the words starting with the first word in Genesis to the last word in Malachi a total of 602,582 add this to the number of books 39 and verses 929 total is the same as the number in numbers 1:46 , 603,550. the total number of words in the old and new testament can be calculated from genesis 6:3. it is 100% correct . <p> How did you come to this conclusion ? What calculation are you referring to in Genesis 6:3 KJV And the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for the he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years . <p> Because God is a God of numbersJesus said even the hairs of your head are all numberedalso there 's a " book of the Bible called " Numbers " also what did God say to AbrahamIf you can count ( emphases added ) the stars of heaven or the sand of the seashorealso even in the Book of Revelation the Spirit of God said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) numbers point to Jesus Christ because He is the creator of " all things " ( including numbers ( emphases added ) <p> You stated under wordy facts for fun that Psalm 117 was the longest chapter in the Bible but actually it is the shortest . Psalm 119 is the longest . You also stated that the Gospel of John is has the lowest word count on any book in the Bible , but I am sure you meant 3 John . I enjoyed the article though . Have a blessed day ! <p> Also there are 879 verses in the Gospel of John.There are 929 chapters in the Old Testament.922-879=50so you can start at John 1vs 1 and it parallels all the way up to Malachi 4vs6 with John21 vs25.Now why is Genesis excluded because The Gospel of John was written to the church ( and its all about who Jesus really is ) and if your in the church ( the true church ) we already know that Christ is the Creator.Also that 's why you read JohnIf you come away reading John and you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you missed the point of why John was written in the first place and John emphases this in the Book of John itself . <p> I command you not to worry about how many words are in the Bible , but to love your fellow man . As men , you can not into meaning of the words my Father wrote because you are fallible . When y try to interpret the words , you corrupt them with your own sins . You must love everyone , even those who you thin you hate ( if you hate anyone , you do n't  know word of God ) . The Bibles words are Gods words , but the meaning behind these words can only be known to God <p> I came here because I 'm looking for information as to whether the different word counts of the bible change the meanings from bible to bible , and to what extent . Does anyone have information on this issue ? I would guess that having a different number of words would change the meaning of each bible a little at a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of the words in the bible change depending on the number of words in each bible ? <p> I wrote this on another article about the number of pages in the bible , but it makes sense to post it here too . Why do Christians that bibles that have different numbers of words are the word of god ? Its obvious that humans have influenced what is written in these books or they would all be the same number of words . Since they do n't  , its apparent that the bible is n't the word of god , but the words of people . <p> Jack the original old testament Hebrew and the new testament greek are the original languages of the BIBLE . The word count remains constant in the original languages . Now if want to read the Bible in English , French , Spanish , German , or any other tongue than Hebrew or Greek their will be different amount of words for each language . Its called TRANSLATION . A former post explained this . Some languages have masculine and feminine tenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being ignorant is one thing , but being obtuse is another . <p> Your argument might hold weight if the number of words in each different language had the same number of words , but this is not the case . In English , every major bible version has a different number of words . Even worse , different editions of the same version have different number of words basically people changing the words as new additions come out . since it is n't God changing them . before you begin name calling you might want to look in the mirror to see who is the one being ignorant and obtuse . <p> If someone else repeats what you wrote , are they still your words ? Just because the language changes or it is written in a different style does not make the words any less yours . But you are correct in one sense , they are not the words of god , they are the words of God . <p> " In God We Trust " are the only words that matter in the Bible . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and you will get to go to Heaven . That 's why our money has Gods word on it . <p> You do realize that the words " In God We Trust " are n't  written anywhere in the Bible , do n't  you ? I think you may need to do a little more reading of the book before you start making comments about what 's in it and not in it . " In God We Trust " is written on US currency , not in the Bible . <p> You do n't  know what you 're talking about . You should read the bible and youll see its there . Where to you think we got the phrase In God We Trust ? It did n't  just come out of thin air . It came from God so we would TRUST Him . <p> You might want to reread your Bible . Maybe you should read it for the first time since your statement makes it sound like you have never opened the Book . " In God We trust " is nowhere in the Bible . You should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When I see comments like this I wonder if the people who say they 're so much into God and the Bible actually have ever read what they claim to know so much about . Anyone who thinks that the words " In God We Trust " is written in the Bible has obviously never read the Bible . To go around preaching how great God and the Bible is without ever actually reading the book is pretty damn hypocritical . <p> You 're the one who has n't  read the Bible . Where else would that come from ? Only God . He wants us to TRUST Him so he made it the national motto of the US . It could only come from the Bible because its what God wants . <p> Holly , The concept of trusting God is certainly in the Bible . But what these other people are telling you is that the phrase " In God We Trust " is our national motto and printed on all US money but that phrase itself does not appear anywhere in the Bible . If you disagree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , and verse ( please include the Bible translation you use ) in your reply . Have a blessed day . <p> Wrong . Eisenhower added " Under God " to the pledge because he was super religious and wanted to separate the United States from the unholy image of the Nazis . The countrys original pledge has nothing to do with God whatsoever and it was never mentioned in the constitution . Seems like a silly thing for your little God to do of those that believe . <p> The enemy wants us to argue over the details and differences in each others interpretation . Divide and conquer . <p> Jesus wants us to LOVE each other , as he loves us , we are to love one another . = <p> So regardless how many words each version or translation has . For all who seek to follow Jesus the word is LOVE . Love God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wow so simple . If all people loved Jesus and all other people we would have heaven on earth today . <p> You can do this without the bible . Why not do it because its the right thing to do and not because a book tells you to do it ? I agree we should all do it , but we should do it because we know its the right thing to do , not because a book tells us to . <p> How about we just love each other and treat each other with respect without the threat of eternity damnation and torture to urge us to do so . Do it because you want to , because you love your fellow man not because you are scared of your religions punishment . If you only do something because you 're scared of the consequence then it is n't something you truly believe . You want the incentive you hypocritical ass . <p> People , this is an estimate . There will be a lot to look at that will change the number , but if you take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate word count for it . Stop complaining and take the information for what it is . <p> I cant believe all the religious crap that gets spewed for an article about how many words there are in the Bible . Its a simple question incomes with the simple answer . Nobody cares about what your religious beliefs are when they come to this article . They 're just interested in learning how many words there are in the Bible . Keep your opinions about what religious means to yourself and focus on the question being asked . <p> All these comments make me feel bad for this country . The fact that so many people feel that it is appropriate to tell others how they should live and what they should believe when this country was founded on freedom of believing whatever you wanted and not what others told you to shows how many people do n't  understand why those who were religiously persecuted King here in the first place . Now those who were persecuted are doing the same to those who do n't  believe the same things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all because somebody wrote an article about how many words there are in the Bible . Its shameful . <p> I would have guessed that the Bible had over 1 million words . I 'm a little surprised that it only has 783,137 words . Still , that 's a lot . And because of the way its written , it takes a lot longer to read than a normal book . <p> I was raised catholic and was an altar boy just like my older brothers . What an honor to serve in the house of the Lord . I kept God in my heart always . I knew good from evil and what was pleasing to God and what was n't . It was when I stopped fellowshipping with God that the conviction did n't  have the influence over me as much .

He called my wife to be by my side and told me her name , yep I freaked out . He looked at me and said God says you are having financial trouble , you get a check then you do n't  get a check for a week or two . He asked what is wrong and I told him . Here comes the blessing , he said to my wife hang onto your husband cause the blessing will go into you and then into her .

Three weeks to the day when I got home from work I went to the answering machine and there was five jobs on it . From the start I got to see miracles and I kepted seeking God . After twenty five years I can say that the God of Israel , the God of the holy bible is the one and only true God . No other faith can prove the power of any other gods . It is the one that works , that 's the faith , Some faiths say that there faith has the same god but why does some faiths say to kill the Jews and Christians . Why would God say to do that To his children . Read the bible and quit arguing about it . It is Gods love letter to all of mankind . You can learn as much as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ his son and his forgiveness . God will put in you his spirit to live in you and he will lead you into all truth . As you study his word and pray Gods Holy Spirit will help you to understand what you are reading . See how smart God is , He has it all set up just trust him . Say Lord Jesus I want to know you I am a sinner and want to be forgiven , I believe you died for me and rose again for my sins to be forgiven Be my Lord and Savior and put your Holy Spirit in me Now help me to grow and live the life you offer and thank you for eternal life . God is love so love everyone . God loves purity so stay pure <p> I 've never believed in God and most people would consider that I 've lived a charmed life . Love comes from within you , not from some non existent external force . If you can learn that , then you can give love unconditionally without fear .

The aim of this article is to de-fog the fogginess surrounding these two ( we 've already done so with was vs were , further away vs farther away , and onto vs on to ) . One of these forms is correct , and the other is just plain wrong . Would anyone care to lay bets before we continue by explaining which is which ? <h> " Each " Refers to How Many ? <p> To get the answer were looking for , we should begin by looking at the word " each . " It automatically implies that we are talking about one of the following : a single object or person , a group of things , or people that can be regarded as a unit . <p> To put this more clearly , you would n't use a pluralized word after " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique markings , " but you would never say " each animals have unique markings . " If you were to modify the sentence to " Each of the animals has unique markings , " were once again looking at a single animal at a time . <p> You could talk about " each people , " but then you would be talking about individual races , which turns the word " people " into a singular that could be pluralized as " peoples . " For example : " Each people has its own culture , " means that the French culture differs from the German culture , and so on . It would be a slightly odd way of expressing the idea , but it would n't be wrong because in the example " people " is singular . <p> The bottom line with all of this ?

While there is a plural form for " other " which is " others , " it differs from the example of " people " since it has no alternative meaning and can not be pluralized yet again . <p> Returning to that example , we could say that " people " means a whole lot of persons , or we could use it to indicate race : " The Turks are a people who love their coffee . The Turks and the Greeks are two peoples who have often been at war . " There is no such alternative meaning for " others . " Its the plural form of " other " and that 's all there is to it . <h> Sticking to the Rule <p> The rule is that " each " will always be followed by a singular .

Although he has woven fictional characters into the narrative , he carefully researched real-life events by interviewing people and reading first-hand accounts of the French invasion of Russia .

" For those who are looking for a general rule of thumb , the answer to the question , " When do you capitalize directions ? " the answer is You capitalize north , east , south and west when they 're part of a proper name , but you do n't  if they only indicate direction . <p> Chances are that one of the reasons you 're here is that you 've noticed that you sometimes see directions capitalized , while at other times you do n't  . The question is , how do you know when you should be using the capital letter ? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 're using a direction to describe nothing but the direction , lower case letters are the ones to choose . For example , if you say " The sun is weakest on the north side ( or northern side ) " lower case letters are fine . In this case , your are using the word " north " to show orientation of the sun , and you 're not using the direction as a proper name . On a side note , the directions in the title of this article are capitalized due to headline capitalization rules even though they merely indicate direction . <p> As soon as you start using directions as part of a proper name , they get capitalized . Its similar to why your name is always capitalized . So , if a person is from South Africa , south would be capitalized since its the proper name of the country . When you 're talking about Americas West Coast or the Middle East , the directional word is also part of a proper name , and it gets a capital letter . Sometimes , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing . For example , you could say a person is from the West or the East meaning they are from the West Coast or the East Coast in the US . Even though you do n't  spell it out completely , you still use a capital letter . <p> To put it in another way that may make it easier to understand , talking about a region , such as Western Europe , means capitals are used . On the other hand , if you tell someone to go south along the freeway , that 's just a direction , and it gets a lowercase letter . This may seem pretty straightforward , but there are times when there is a debate as to whether or not the direction is just a direction , or if its a proper name . <p> Not everyone agrees on whether you should capitalize the direction in a sentence like , " As a Southerner , he had a distinctive drawl . " Some say that you 're talking about someone who is from a particular region , and that a capital letter should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the person lives and does n't  get a capital letter . I 'm inclined to think that the regional opinion is spot on , but this is an example of how differing opinions can lead to one person using a capital letter while another would use a lowercase letter for direction in the same sentence . <h> 7 comments <p> I think I get it and how to capitalize directions now . So its not a mistake that sometimes North is capitalized and sometimes its not . It depends on how the direction is being used in the sentence , right ? <p> I found this post because I was n't sure of the answer to the question . Directions always gave me trouble and I sometimes would capitalize , but not other times . I 'm glad I know now . You certainly learn something new every day . <p> This is why you never want to rely exclusively on spell checkers and grammar checkers . They have a difficult time distinguishing between directions and proper nouns with north , south , east , and west . Its best to always double check knowing the correct rule . 
@@12747102 @1347102/ <h> How Many Words in a Paragraph ? <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences in a paragraph , there 's no single answer to this question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general , you 'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea , and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you 'd expect . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average person does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> " White Space " is a great way to make your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the answer is " It depends " Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a blog post , and I want to keep the reader engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> The above paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers , for example : <p> " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " Cool ! " <p> As you can see , I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves . Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will usually consist of the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips , 2014 ) with references . Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon see why this should be the case ( Me , 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many words per paragraph ? Its really up to you ! <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd . <p> This is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader . A lot of text without " white space " is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to digest . So , whatever you do , do n't  forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to baffle the reader . <p> By the way , the above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This will mostly depend on the writer . Paragraphs will also differ in size due to information being written about and the type of writing being done . I do n't  think anyone can say how many words will be in any given paragraph before its written . Even with the same topic and directions , two writers will have different results . <p> Do n't  listen to @artstudent the comment is nothing more than a troll . The number of words in a paragraph does matter , and although it is fine to rebel , you need to rebel once you have learned how to write your graphs properly . Trying to rebuild before you know how to do that only make you look like a fool . <p> This would seem to be such an easy question to answer , but the answer is 1 word to hundreds of words . I wish there were a more definite answer like 50 or 100 so I could just use that . Why does all aspects of writing have to be so difficult ? <p> Who decides what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you said that there are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , but who has decided that this is the general amount ? Did someone just wake up one day and say that a paragraph should have 100 to 200 words and it ? Where has there been some specific research done that indicates that most paragraphs fall within this range ? <p> Its easy to determine a general number of words in a paragraph . All that needs to be done is take a large data set and then crunch the numbers . If you look at hundreds of thousands of paragraphs you 'll soon see a trend of how many words are in an average paragraph . Sure , there will be some with a lot less and some with a lot more , but in general an average number will appear . Thats 100 to 200 words per paragraph . <p> I like to write long paragraphs . I think that too many people try to break long paragraphs into a number of shorter ones far too often . There is just something special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . People shouldnt try to make their paragraphs too short . Long paragraphs are just so wonderful . <p> Long paragraphs are difficult to read . That 's why you rarely see them in magazines and newspapers ( or online ) . A huge wall of text is never inviting . If you like long paragraphs , there is nothing wrong with that , but you need to be aware that fewer people will actually read what you write . <p> I like to write short paragraphs . I think that too many people try to combine short paragraphs into a number of longer ones far too often . There is just something special about reading a short paragraph that conveys the essence of the story . People should n't try to make their paragraphs too long . Short paragraphs are just so wonderful . <p> That would depend on how many words are in each sentence which can vary greatly . Most sentences have about 6 words , so a guestimate would be 48 words . If you stick the paragraph into https : //wordcounter.net/ it will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Usually , 150-180 depending on the length of your sentences . Admin said 48 , but 6 word-sentences are not commonly used if you are doing an academic paper ( analysis , informative , argumentative essay ) rather than freelance writing for creativity or leisure . the smallest sentence in an essay Im writing is 10 words . And there are not many of those . The rest average between 12-30 words . If you are in high school ( I am a HS senior ) , I suggest using a more academic vocabulary that will make your sentences fuller . But , only make them longer if it is necessary and meaningful , not to reach a word count . That 's when sentences become run-ons and you lose points . If you are in Jr High , get used to being thorough yet concise . Not too verbose ! Just a good medium . You 'll find a balance as you grow as a writer and form your own style . I know this is late lol , but I hope that helps = <p> Some people count proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proverbs ( A stitch in time saves nine ) , idioms ( make ends meet ) , titles ( Little House on the Prairie ) , and similes ( as hardworking as an ant ) as one single word . Is it correct ? <p> Does anyone truly care about this ? I mean , who cares how many words are in a paragraph ? Name me one person who would care about this ? And if you can , you have named someone who needs to reevaluate what they care about in life . <p> I think an important point that has n't  been mentioned in the comments is that a paragraph should be about a single idea . That means that the number of words in a paragraph will depend on how long you spend on that single idea . If you have a lot to say about that single idea , the paragraph will be long . If you do n't  have a lot to say about that idea , the paragraph will be short . I do n't  think you should be concentrating on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still on the same topic within the paragraph . <p> I see so many students who do n't  understand this and break up a single idea into several paragraphs . Then there are other students to take several ideas and lump them all into the same paragraph . If you can understand the concept of a single idea for a paragraph , it will solve a lot of your problem . <p> You cant write well without understanding the structure of a paragraph . I see so many students try to squeeze a number of different ideas into a single paragraph and this immediately tells me they do n't  understand what its for and how its used . <p> I do n't  understand why so many people worry about things like this . If you 're trying to write well , the number of words for each paragraph should naturally take place . Trying to force a specific number of words into each paragraph will ruin your writing . <p> Its a general rule of thumb , not a one that ca n't be broken . So much depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot for , but there are a lot of reasons to deviate from it depending on what you 're writing . <p> Those are some pretty short paragraphs . I would find it difficult to express all the information in such a short paragraph for most of my writing . There are times when they can be this short , but I would say most should be a lot longer . <p> This is something that everyone who is commenting on seems to be overanalyzing . Do n't  try to constrict yourself into a certain number of words per paragraph . If you write well , paragraphs will naturally come about and be the number of words they need to be . If you try to cram too many words into them to make them longer or cut out a bunch of words to make them shorter , in all likelihood the paragraphs wont seem natural . Write the best thing you can in the paragraph should naturally flow . <p> This is fine unless the assignment has a word and paragraph limit . I have an assignment that requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher to be this specific for a paper , but she does stuff like this all the time .

Read on and be liberated ! Together well wreak havoc on the Grammar Nazis ! To understand why I 'm going against the mainstream opinion , you need to know only one thing : I have a darned good source to back me up . <p> To begin with , let 's look at some word meanings : <p> Wreaked : Caused <p> Wrought : Worked <p> Now let 's look at some sentences for the sake of context : <p> " The hurricane has caused havoc in the town " <p> " The hurricane has wreaked havoc in the town . " <p> " The hurricane has worked havoc in the town . " <p> " The hurricane has wrought havoc in the town . " <p> Guess what ? They 're all correct . Of course , if you were using " wrought " under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 'd be wrong , but intention does n't  show or matter in this case . <p> Some may say that " worked havoc " is a trifle odd , but it has also been suggested by many as a rather more modern word that could be used to replace " wreaking " which we seldom do these days . <p> However , there is one thing that a hurricane never , ever does : <p> " The hurricane wrecked havoc . " <p> This would imply that a remarkably tidy hurricane arrived in a crazy town that was in a state of utter chaos , and tidied everything away neatly , thereby depriving the citizens of the havoc they were enjoying so much . Truth be told , I could use a hurricane like that around my house . <h> Wrought vs Wreaked <p> I mentioned earlier I had a good source to go against the conventional wisdom of the meaning of these two words . To tell you the truth , I always thought " wrought " and " wreaked " were interchangeable , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the encyclopedia I carry around in my own head . My authority is none other than the Oxford English Dictionary , and you do n't  get a posher source than that . So next time someone thinks they 're clever and tries to tell you that " wrought " is the wrong word to use with " havoc " or " chaos , " you can tell them they 're Grammar Nazis of the worst kind . That is , they 're the kind that 's altogether adamant about being grammatically wrong , and you can refer them to the Oxford Dictionary to make your point . <p> Moving on , there is a word that has nothing to do with havoc , but is often mistakenly used as such . <h> Wreak vs Reek : The very bad smell of havoc <p> " The air force bombers reeked havoc on our enemies " <p> Do you think the military has mastered the art of creating the worst ever stink bombs ? Or is it possible that our enemies smelled so strongly of havoc that our air force got a whiff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . <p> You could say : <p> " The disgusting odor of the sewers wreaked chaos among residents as they fled the dreadful miasma . " <p> But you could never say : <p> " Gosh that wreaks of ammonia ! " or " The wreak of the sewers was disgusting ! " <p> Well , I suppose you could write it if you wanted to , but it would be wrong , and everybody who reads it would know it was wrong . <p> Generally speaking , a bad odor " reeks " and can only " wreak " if it causes something else that is quite unpleasant to happen . <h> 7 comments <p> Thank you for your series of explanations on similar words and the correct usage of them . ts helped me a lot n my writing . Wreak and wrought has always been extremely confusing to me a I now understand the two words better ! <p> Does anyone even use the words wrought and wreaked anymore ? I do n't  think Ive ever heard anyone use those words in my life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever uses anymore . <p> I have to disagree . I always learned that it was wrought havoc by my teachers . Wreaked havoc does n't  sound right and I never learned that so I think its wrong . Its best to stay with what you learned in school in my opinion .

" the answer is there are 3 to 8 sentences in a paragraph . The important key to take away from this answer is that its a rule-of-thumb . If you 're looking for a hard and fast rule , you 're out of luck . A paragraph can consist of a single sentence , and since a single word can be a sentence , you can literally have a paragraph that consists of a single word . Of course , if someone asks you to write a paragraph , they wont be altogether happy with that , so how much should you write ? <h> What do teachers want to see in a paragraph ? <p> If you 're a student , your teacher or tutor may ask you to write a paragraph without telling you just how long he or she expects it to be . In general , educators like to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentence that expresses an idea . Use the next 3 sentences for providing information that supports that idea , and use the final sentence to draw a conclusion . <p> Why do teachers expect longer paragraphs ? Obviously , they want to see that you have acquired knowledge and can think critically . That 's quite difficult- to demonstrate with a single sentence ! Teachers will sometimes set a rule that all paragraphs should be a certain length , but its important to remember that specific paragraph lengths are n't  a prerequisite for acceptable writing . <h> When do you use shorter paragraphs ? <p> Open just about any book , and you 'll find plenty of short paragraphs . If direct speech is used , therell be a new paragraph every time a new speaker starts to talk . News writers also like using short paragraphs . They have to present information in a succinct way and hold the readers attention . <p> Commercial writers know that most people do n't  want to read 1,000 words of closely-spaced text in order to see what they are writing about , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theyll even use lots of sub-headers so you can see what each paragraph is about before you read it . <h> How do I know when to start a new paragraph ? <p> Every time you begin- to discuss a new thought that contributes to the overarching theme of your work , you can start- a new paragraph . A paragraph will usually consist of a collection of sentences that , when considered as a group , have something in common . As soon as you move on to the next idea , you can begin a new paragraph . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to agonise about it too much , because as I 've pointed out , there are no specific rules . <h> Tips for writing strong paragraphs <p> Its best to begin a paragraph with a sentence that defines the topic that will be discussed . Try to keep it fairly simple . If you include too many ideas in your opening sentence , you run the risk of getting tangled in an overly complex and incoherent paragraph . Every sentence in a paragraph should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you begin discussing a new or related topic , start a new paragraph . <p> The University of North Carolina helps students with paragraph construction by providing them with a 5-step process : <p> Express the idea that the paragraph will cover in a topic sentence . <p> Explain the idea . <p> Use an example . <p> Explain why the example relates to the idea . <p> Draw a conclusion . <p> Obviously , the recipe has been designed for those who want to write an informative and convincing work . And because these rules are n't  really cast in stone , you 'll find that different institutions give different recommendations . <h> The debate continues <p> If we look around , well find that the idea of paragraphs with a minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common .

Meanwhile , journalism students are taught to keep sentences as short as possible , and one sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who say that using more than one paragraph to discuss an idea is perfectly alright , and since there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs , I cant really contradict them .

I like shorter paragraphs for informal writing such as this blog post . I like the idea of sticking to one idea per paragraph , and I think that paragraphs make reading and understanding a text a whole lot simpler . Single-sentence paragraphs are great for emphasis . <p> If you are writing to pass a school , college or university course , I recommend you ask your teacher or professor what 's expected of you .

As mentioned above , there is no exact answer to how many sentences there should be in a paragraph and you 'll find this true with a lot of these questions . <p> Its good to hear you found this helpful . As stated in the article , there are a lot of factors that can affect the number of sentences in a paragraph and there are no hard set rules , but I 'm happy the general rule of thumb is helpful for what you need . <p> This will depend on the assignment , topic and also what is asked . It is so difficult to answer this without knowing the specifics . I think this article is a great guide to check out when you start writing , but it will never give you a definitive answer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is good information to know . My question is , does it really matter how long each sentence is within the paragraph ? For example , if I write eight sentences , but each sentence is only three or four words long , do I need to extend the paragraph so that maybe it has 12 to 14 sentences ? On the other hand , if I write long sentences such as 10 to 12 words each , can I get away with only four sentences in the paragraph ? Does the length of the sentence matter at all or is this something that I shouldnt be worried about with my writing ? <p> No ! You should separate the paragraphs when there is a change of topic , not based on the number of sentences or the sentence length . If you did it like that , the paragraphs would be quite difficult to read and the flow would be terrible . <p> These our general rules . Do n't  focus on them as much his writing well . That 's really what it all comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its not going to matter how many sentences are in each paragraph . If you do n't  write well , the number of sentences that you have in each paragraph may be an issue along with a lot of other things . Just write the best that you can and you should be okay . <p> I think its really interesting the flexibility the English language allows for how many sentences are in a paragraph . The fact that there are n't  any set rules and it depends so much on the context of what 's being written makes the English language fluid and alive . Thin how boring English would be if every paragraph had to be the same length with the same number of sentences ? Embrace the flexibility which allows you to be creative when writing in English . <p> Those who are so concerned about getting an exact answer for this question fail to realize what you just said . The reason that there is n't an exact answer is because the language is so fluid and flexible . Its what makes English such a fun language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken or played with , English would be such a boring language . Be happy that there is n't an exact answer for how many sentences are there in a paragraph because if there was an exact answer , English would be a lot more boring overall . <p> This is the stupidest question I have ever come across . Of course there is no answer . How many sentences in a paragraph will depend on each paragraph that 's written . Even somebody in kindergarten would understand that . Why would anybody even ask a question like this ? <p> Just because it does n't  make sense to you does n't  mean that its a stupid question . English is n't my native language so I was n't sure if there was a rule about paragraphs . I thought maybe that a paragraph needed a minimum of three sentences so I decided to look it up on the Internet . There are legitimate reasons why somebody like me would want to know the answer to this question . <p> I try to write a minimum of five sentences per paragraph . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , but I think that 's a good goal especially when you 're writing essays for school work . I think by having a goal you end up writing better , but you need to understand that the goal can be broken in certain circumstances . I 'm not sure if that will help anybody who comes across this article , but that 's what I do when it comes to paragraphs . <p> I 'm surprised people can get so worked up about a topic that does n't  have an exact answer . If you need to have an exact answer for everything in life , you 're going to have a hard time . The number of sentences will be different for each person . Nobody writes the same way . And if you write one sentence or ten sentences , neither is wrong . <p> This is exactly what I was thinking . Its hilarious that people are getting worked up about how many sentences should be in a paragraph . In the scheme of things , this does n't  even rate a blip on the radar . Write ans many sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wrote that many to your professor . <p> lol . This answer does n't  say anything just like the article . How many sentences does a paragraph need ? 1 to 1000 take your choice . Basically , as many or as few as you want . This whole article can be summed up as " however many you want . " <p> I was always taught that there should be five sentences in the paragraph . I understand that there can be more or less , but if you 're shooting for a good paragraph and you 're worried about the number of sentences , five is a good number to shoot for . That gives you the opportunity to do an introduction sentence , three sentences that explain your point , and then a concluding sentence . If you have all of these in a paragraph , it should be a good quality paragraph . <p> I think the five sentences per paragraph rule is one that teachers use when trying to get students to understand what a paragraph is . It may be a good rule for students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty limiting if you try to use it with everything you write . If you 're trying to make your paragraphs 5 sentences long when you 're an adult , you 're limiting your writing creativity . <p> I was taught 5 sentences when I was in school , but I always found it limiting and often argued with my teacher about it . I think teachers teach it for their own ease instead of helping students expand on creating creative paragraphs .

This seems so trivial . I mean , I never think about the number of sentences I have in each paragraph when I 'm writing . I just write in whatever happens to work is what appears in each paragraph .

@@12747106 @1347106/ <h> How Many Paragraphs Is 1,000 Words ? <p> This seemingly idle question may not be all that simple to answer . One thing is sure , 1,000 words all written without any paragraph spacing will drive your reader a little mad . The first point is clear : 1,000 words is a lot of words . Split it up into paragraphs for heavens sake , or expect your intended readers to head for the hills for a chance to rest their weary eyes on some open space . <p> So given you need to transform your 1,000 words into something easy on the eyes , you know you have to split it into paragraphs . How do you do that ? <h> A Sentence Is an Idea , a Paragraph Is Closely Related Ideas <p> Whatever you 're discussing , you 'll discover a number of concepts which you presumably planned before you started writing . To make it all hang together nicely , you add a bit of space when you transition from one area of discussion to another . As with any rule , there are exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for paragraphs in the 100-200 word range . <p> Bear in mind that academic and essay writing usually means you 're writing for a fairly dedicated reader , but what about the huge chunk of the population who are frightened off by big chunks of text , even if they are only six or seven lines long ( depending on font ) ? <h> Journalists and Commercial Writers Keep Their Paragraphs Short <p> " White space " is a wonderful illusion that tells your reader what you have to say is pretty easy to take in . I 've seen some news articles in which each paragraph is only one sentence long . I feel that 's taking it to extremes , and it can have the opposite effect of making your writing look disjointed . I like to see at least three or four lines to a paragraph , and as an indication , my longest paragraph so far is just 74 words long . <p> You can assume commercial writing and news reports will have paragraphs approximately half as long as the ones youd see in academic or essay writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs per 1,000 words instead of five to ten . <h> Dialogues Have a New Paragraph for Every New Speaker <p> One context in which a paragraph can be as short as five characters is direct speech involving two or more speakers . <p> " Oh ! " <p> Count em : two characters for the word , and three for the punctuation marks . To begin with , youd introduce or refer to your speakers , but once the conversation is flowing nicely , you can start skipping them at times . <p> " No ! " exclaimed Mary . <p> " Yes ! " John couldnt help being amused at Marys surprise . <p> " You do n't  really mean it , do you ? " <p> " Of course I mean it , silly ! " <p> Its a lot less cumbersome to skip a mention of the speaker than to add " said Mary " and " John said " after every direct quote . So theoretically , you can have a paragraph consisting of one word plus punctuation marks . 1,000 words in direct speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten paragraphs our initial guideline suggested . <h> How Many Paragraphs in 1,000 Words ? <p> here 's a basic summary . <p> Probably not less than 5 paragraphs . <p> For easy reading , probably no less than 10 . <p> For direct speech , one for every time you change speaker ( however many times that is ) . <h> Does It Matter ? <p> Not necessarily , but bear in mind that even teachers who are paid to read students writing get tired eyes . The easier it is to read and understand what you have written , the more likely your teacher is to notice those clever details you included . There 's also a distinct possibility they wont start hating you while they read your work . Yes , they 're supposed to be unbiased , but everyone is human ! <p> When writing in other contexts : an article , a blog , or a book , keeping paragraphs short helps to hold your readers attention . Yes , there are famous writers who just wrote without much attention to paragraphs , or even punctuation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how educated we may be , " easy " is invariably the preferred option . <p> To take easy reading to the next level , try using sub-headers every paragraph to three paragraphs . This is applicable to blogs and web pages , and to a certain extent , in academic writing . When you hit a web page for info , what do you do ? I look at the header , and then I scan the sub-heads to get an idea of the writers approach to the subject . If it looks like fluff , I kill the page and move on . But if the sub-headers are interesting , and seem to tell me there 's something worth learning , I 'll read the whole piece . <h> Whatever You Do , Use Paragraphs <p> Using paragraphs well ( with or without sub-heads ) makes your work more accessible to your reader , and , to a certain extent , it shows you 've ordered your thoughts and are discussing one point at a time . If you cant organize your work into paragraphs consisting of related thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and try again . <h> How Many Paragraphs is <p> The following list is an approximation for those who are writing essays with the standard 100 200 words per paragraph and 50 to 100 words for blog or article easy reading . The actual number of paragraphs will depend on numerous factors and this is nothing more than a general rough estimate . Below are estimated words to paragraphs conversions : <p> 250 words is 1 to 3 paragraphs for essays , 3 to 5 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 500 words is 3 to 5 paragraphs for essays , 5 to 10 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 750 words is 4 to 8 paragraphs for essays , 8 to 15 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1000 words is 5 to 10 paragraphs for essays , 10 to 20 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1500 words is 8 to 15 paragraphs for essays , 15 to 30 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2000 words is 10 to 20 paragraphs for essays , 20 to 40 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2500 words is 13 to 25 paragraphs for essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words is 15 to 30 paragraphs for essays , 30 to 60 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 4000 words is 20 to 40 paragraphs for essays , 40 to 80 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 5000 words is 25 to 50 paragraphs for essays , 50 to 100 paragraphs for easy writing <h> 2 comments <p> I do n't  think the number of paragraphs really matters as long as you reach the assigned word count . paragraphs will vary in the number of words . Just write more if you are short of your count , or less if you 're over it . 
@@12747107 @1347107/ <h> Tag : word count <p> You 're writing your first novel , and you know you must shoot for around 80 to 95 thousand words . Once you know what your book will be about , its time to start planning the structure of the story . What will happen in each chapter , and how much has to happen before you move on to the next chapter ? How many chapters will you need before you reach your target word count ? <h> Its Up to You Within Reason <p> Before you decide your average chapter length , its a good idea to think about the purpose behind dividing a book into chapters . Think of it as a TV series or a play . Each chapter will consist of one or more scenes that contribute to the development of the story . <p> Unlike TV series , you are n't  limited to a certain amount of airtime , so some important scenes may require longer chapters . The important thing is to end each chapter at the end of a scene , allowing your reader to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it does n't  make much sense to have one chapter that takes up a major part of the book while other chapters are much shorter . Admittedly , some published authors have done just that , but your readers may find it a little odd . <p> Your audience may also play a role . For example , books for the youth market often have shorter chapters than those intended for adult readers . Again , it is n't a rule , but if you 're writing for people with a short attention span , shorter chapters make sense . <h> How Long Are the Chapters in Books by Famous Authors ? <p> Looking at what successful authors have done in the past is always a help . That 's why writers should always be readers too . Best-selling books show us what the public likes , and of course , were hoping that our own novels will be liked by the public . Let 's look at some chapter lengths , but remember that these are averages . In any of these books , some chapters are longer than others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4,560 words per chapter . <p> Twilight uses about 4,580 words per chapter . <p> The Hunger Games uses 3,700-word chapters , dividing each chapter into three parts . <h> What Do Most Writers See as a Good Average Chapter Length ? <p> The debate is ongoing . Some will tell you 2,500 words is the average , while others will say that 3,000 to 5,000 word chapters are more likely to be the norm . Most agree that under 1,000 words would be rather short and that over 5,000 might be rather too long . As a general guideline , chapters should be between 3,000 to 5,000 words . <p> All of them agree that the chapter length should be defined by the story and that any chapter length targets you decide on are merely guidelines . Most of them say that trying to keep the chapters within a certain length range is helpful to the reader . <h> Chapter Length Rule 1 : There Are No Rules <p> Writers sometimes use extra-short chapters such as ones that are a sentence or two long for emphasis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentence , or even just a word , will make readers sit up and take note . However , use this technique sparingly . It loses its effect if you regularly do it . <p> There 's also no real rule that says a chapter ca n't be longer than 5,000 words . Daniel Defoe wrote the book Moll Flanders without dividing it into chapters at all , so in theory , you could say that the entire book consisted of just one chapter . However , as a new author , I 'm not sure you would get away with that . <h> Its the Story That Matters Most <p> Trying to pad out an uneventful chapter with thoughts or events that do n't  contribute to your plot will bore your readers leaving them with the impression you 're waffling . Compressing a very exciting scene so you can meet your chapter word count target is also not going to do you any favors . <p> While the idea of chapters in the 3,000 to 5,000-word range is a good guideline when roughing out your books structure , it is n't a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . Build your plot through a series of events or scenes . Then decide for yourself where the chapter divisions will be . You may decide to include two or more scenes in a chapter , or you might stick to one scene per chapter . Just ensure that the division comes at a time when a reader could put the book down if they want a break . Of course , if you keep it exciting enough , your reader will want to know what will happen next , and might have trouble putting the book down at all . <p> Leo Tolstoys historical novel on the Napoleonic invasion of Russia has become a byword for long books . If someone talks about doing something in the time it takes to read War and Peace , you can be sure that they mean its going to take quite a long time , and if your teacher comments that he or she wanted an essay from you , not War and Peace , your essay was way too long . <p> War and Peace is considered Tolstoys masterwork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that though I 've tried a couple of times , I 've never made it through the whole thing . The philosophical passages that make up much of the book are heavy going . If you have read this book , give yourself a medal and a pat on the back . You deserve it . <h> How many words are there in War and Peace ? <p> War and Peace has 587,287 words , making it more than ten times longer than your NaNoWriMo novel . Tolstoy completed his first draft in 1863 , but he later spent three years rewriting most of it . One would think after spending so much time on one book , Tolstoy would have been too exhausted to write anymore , but he went on to write Ana Karenina , which was published in 1877 , as well as several other novels . <h> Is War and Peace the longest novel ever ? <p> Remembering War and Peace was written as a four-volume set with two epilogs , its fair if we include some series . If we do that , we come across several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one million words . The word count for the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan takes the record : 4,410,036 words ! Just imagine writing more than four million words . <p> Did you think that The Lord of the Rings would be near the top of the list ? Think again ! Tolkien managed to write his classic in " just " 481,103 words . If its one of your favorites , you now know something about it that you did n't  know before . <h> How Heavy Is War and Peace ? <p> The actual weight of the book depends on the edition and whether or not its paperback or hardback . As the above photo shows , the hardback version can weigh almost 4 pounds ( 3 lbs , 14 oz ) . Of course , paperbacks would weigh much less . <h> How Many Pages is War and Peace ? <p> The 587,287 words in War and Peace end up being 1,215 pages . Again , the page number will vary from edition to edition due to different sized pages and print used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , a Russian author , so for us to be able to read his novel , it first had to be translated into English . This was done for the first time in 1885 by Clara Bell , who translated it from the French version . This re-translated translation was far from perfect , and ten further translations into English have been done since . <p> War and Peace has been translated into German , French , Spanish , Dutch , Finnish , Swedish , Korean , Albanian and Czech . You must respect all these brave translators ; what a massive job to tackle ! <p> Interestingly , a large portion of the book is written in French , but at the time , the nobility in Russia often spoke French as a matter of course , and some of them could barely speak Russian . <h> Is War and Peace a novel ? <p> Tolstoy himself said his book was not really a novel in the truest sense of the word . Although he has woven fictional characters into the narrative , he carefully researched real-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French invasion of Russia . Only the first half of War and Peace deals with fictional characters ; the rest consists mostly of essays on war , power , and history . <p> Tolstoy did n't  agree with the way military history is recorded and tried to get closer to the real events by portraying them through the eyes of real and fictional characters . The names of over 160 people who lived during that time are mentioned in his work . <h> What makes Tolstoy so special as a writer ? <p> Apart from having written an extremely long book , Tolstoy was admired for his writing style . Just as movie cameras give us an overview of a scene , pan in , and pan out , so Tolstoy took readers from the " big picture " to the personal experiences of his characters and back again . This style of writing was relatively new , and Tolstoy is considered to be its master . In addition , he wanted people to be able to accurately visualize scenes , so he included a wealth of detail . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly looked at philosophies and facts , he managed to weave his essays into the story . Some abridged versions have taken these , and the second part of the epilog , which consisted solely of essays , out . <p> Is it literary sacrilege to edit Tolstoy ? Well , its a long book , and not all of it is really a " story . " Even when Tolstoy was still alive , abridged versions of his work were produced , presumably with his permission . <h> A little more about the man behind War and Peace <p> Tolstoy was born Lev Nikolayevitch Tolstoy in 1828 . He was born into the privileged aristocratic class and had the title of Count . In his younger days , he was a typical , dissolute aristocrat , but his first-hand experience of war , his travels , and his reading led him to a spiritual crisis and reawakening . He became a fervent Christian and a pacifist whose works inspired the likes of Gandhi . He died in 1910 at the ripe old age of 82 . <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of maximum word count limit , the question of whether or not footnotes and endnotes should be counted toward this limit can come up . Those who have an essay that is under word count are hoping that their footnotes and endnotes can be counted while those who are over the limit want to make sure that these do n't  count . Which one is it ? <h> Footnotes <p> Do footnotes count when doing a word count ? No , footnotes do n't  count in the word count in most cases . When a teacher or professor gives an assignment with a minimum or maximum limit , its usually done with the intent of being applicable to the topic being assigned . Footnotes are auxiliary information that further clarifies certain points being made in the essay . Since this is n't a part of the body of the essay , most teachers and professors do not count footnotes as part of the essays word count . <p> This is a general rule of thumb . There can be exceptions depending on the teacher giving the assignment , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not footnotes should or should n't be included . If this is not possible , its best to assume that they are not counted . <p> Do footnotes count in a page count ? Yes , footnotes generally count toward page count . Footnotes are found at the bottom of the page and do n't  take up much of the page space in most instances . While its relatively easy to exclude footnotes from a word count , its much more difficult to exclude them from a page count . For this reason , most professors allow them to be included as part of the overall page count . <p> Again , counting footnotes as part of the page count is a general rule of thumb , not a definitive answer . Its always best to ask the person assigning the essay to confirm that this is OK . If you find yourself in a position where this is n't possible , in most cases it should be acceptable . <h> Endnotes <p> Do endnotes count in a word count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endnotes give further information to a point made in an essay but are n't  part of the body of the essay . For this reason , endnotes are generally not included in an essays word count . The best policy is to ask directly if you are n't  sure about this , but when in doubt , its better not to count them . <p> Do endnotes count in a page count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a page count most of the time . There is one significant difference between footnotes and endnotes which is endnotes are found at the end of the essay and not at the bottom of each page . Being at the end , its much easier to exclude them from a page count than it is to exclude footnotes . For this reason , endnotes are n't  usually counted when doing an assignment with a specific page count . <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general , you 'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea , and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you 'd expect . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your readers attention and get them to read what you 've written . The average person does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the answer is " It depends " Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a blog post , and I want to keep the reader engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses 37 words . <p> I want to get your attention ! <p> The above paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " Cool ! " <p> As you can see , I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves . Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long . <h> Academic Writing <p> In academic writing , paragraphs will usually consist of the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon see why this should be the case ( Me , 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many words per paragraph ? Its really up to you ! <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . <p> Making them too short , can look a little odd . <p> This is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to digest . So , whatever you do , do n't  forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to baffle the reader . <p> By the way , the above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't always better ? I 'm ready to bet that you do . <p> For anyone who has taken the time to manually count the number of words on a page of paper , you know its both time consuming and frustrating . There has to be a better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for your own writing , but what if you need to know the exact number of words for a particular page ? Getting this information is a bit more difficult . <p> There could be a number of reasons you want to know how many words are on a page . Many times its because you have an assignment which requires you to write a certain number of pages , so youd like to know how many words are needed to fill a page . The problem is there 's not a definitive answer to this questions because there are so many factors that go into calculating the number of words on a page . <p> For those looking for a general rule of thumb , you can estimate that there are about 250 words on a page double spaced , or 500 words on a page single spaced . This is a rough estimate and the true number of words on the page is likely to be more or less . This may not be a big factor for the single page , but if you are estimating for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly different than the estimated number . <p> If you know some basics about the writing and the page , you can get a much more accurate estimate by using a Words per Page calculator . This will allow you to input the font type ( Arial , Calibri , Comic Sans MS , Courier , Times New Roman or Verdana ) , the font size , and whether the page is single or doubled spaced . Using this information and the number of words , the calculator can give a more accurate estimate than using the rule-of-thumb estimate . You also have the option of using the " type your own Words " function to get the estimated number of pages for your writing . <p> Another reason you may be searching for how many words there are on a page is you may want to know the number of words for a particular page on the Internet . Since web pages are n't  limited to the size of a standard sheet of paper , the actual number of words on the page can vary wildly , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases like this , you can use a Website Page Word Count calculator . <p> To find out this word count information , you simply input the URL of the websites page for which you need to know the number of words and the calculator will tell you exactly how many are on that particular page . Even better , it will also give you a list of the words used on the page including how many times each word is used . <p> If you came to Word Counter to find out how many words happened to be in a piece you 'd written , youve likely noticed we offer a lot more information than just word count . While we started out primarily as a simple way for you to be able to count the number of words you had written , we 've added a number of other Details to the counter over time .

The 10 Details options include the following : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written . <p> Unique Words : This tells you the number of unique words you have written . In the previous sentence , 11 words were written , but only 10 unique words were written because the word " you " was written twice . <p> Characters : This tells you the number of character spots which have been used including the blank spaces between words when writing . <p> Characters ( no spaces ) : This tells you the number of characters you 've written not counting the blank spaces between words . <p> Sentences : This tells you the number of sentences you 've written . <p> Avg . Sentence ( words ) : This tells you the average word length of all the sentences you 've written . For example , if you write two sentences and one is 10 words and the other is 8 words , the average sentence length would be 9 words . <p> Avg . Sentence ( chars ) : This tells you the average number of characters in each sentence . This calculation includes the blank spaces between the words . <p> Paragraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reading Level : Reading level gives an approximation of what grade level the person reading your writing would need to have completed to understand what you have written . You can get a better understanding of reading level here . <p> Reading Time : Reading time gives you an estimate of how long it would take for you to read what you have written . This is based on the average reading speed of 275 words per minute . <p> There 's a good chance that you are n't  currently seeing all of the above-mentioned Details in your sidebar . That 's because only six are turned on by default when you visit the site . The default Details shown are Words , Characters , Sentences , Paragraphs , Reading Level , and Reading Time . The other four ( Unique Words , Characters no spaces , Average Sentence words , and Average Sentence characters ) have to be turned on for you to see them . <p> In order to see all of the above 10 metrics displayed , you can click the " Options " button ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once in " Options , " you can then choose " Details " at the top .

As part of the challenge , I will explain some of the methods Ive developed over the years , and I hope others who are also doing this challenge ( or who have done a similar challenge in the past ) , will contribute their insights and tips to the conservation as well . <p> As I explained in a previous article , there are a number of steps anyone who decides to take up a challenge like this should consider and answer to better define the challenge . Doing so will make it more likely the challenge is completed . Here are my answers to each step : <p> Step one : How many words will I write each day ? 1000 . <p> Step two : What 's the minimum number of words I must write each day ? 100 . <p> Step three : How long will the challenge be ? One month ( during October ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? No . <p> Step five : How will I let others know about the challenge to keep myself honest ? I will be doing this by recording it on this blog throughout the month . <p> Step six : How will I keep track and record my daily word count throughout the challenge ? I will do it here on this blog . <p> If Im successful with the challenge , I will have written a minimum of 31,000 words by the end of the month . Going by past experience , even if I do n't  reach the goal , I should write more than I would have without the challenge as long as I continue it for the entire 31 days . That 's a vitally important point for all these challenges . While you should do your best to achieve the goal , the true benefit from these type of challenges is to get you writing on a daily basis , and to write more than you would have if you had n't  undertaken the challenge in the first place . <p> So I put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin a 1000 word a day challenge for a month and see what you can produce . If you have any questions along the way , feel free to ask them in the comments of any challenge article . While I 'm doing this to keep me accountable for the number of words I write this month , I also want to try and help any writer who is having problems writing consistently over a period of time . <p> Below are a list of articles Ive put together as part fo this challenge on tips and hints you may be able to incorporate into your own writing habits to increase your productivity : <p> This- is a question we get from time to time . There are instances- when you 're given an assignment , not by word count , but assigned by the number of pages . For example , " Write a paper four pages long . " If you get an assignment to write four pages , one of the first questions that will likely come to mind is , " How many words are in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per page , you can use a words per page calculator . <p> The truth is there is no definitive answer to this question . The number of words it will take to fill a page will depend on a number of factors including the type of font used , the font size , spacing elements , the margins used on the paper , the paragraph length , etc . For example , if the assignment says the writing should be in 10-point font , its going to take a greater number of words to fill a page than if the assignment requires a 12-point font . <p> For those who need a general rule of thumb , a typical page which has 1-inch margins and is typed in 12 point font with standard spacing elements will be approximately 500 words when typed single spaced . For assignments that require double spacing , it would take approximately 250 words to fill the page . For an assignment that requires you to write four pages , you can make the estimation that you 'll need to write approximately 2000 words for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is double spaced . Again , the type of font used can make the word count higher or lower , but its a good rule of thumb for those who are simply looking for a general estimation . <p> Since there can be a large variation on the number of words needed to fill a page , most papers are no longer assigned by page count . They are instead assigned by word count . That is , an assignment , essay or paper will likely be assigned as 1500 2000 words rather than 3 4 pages . This way it is much more difficult for the writer to " game the system " by using large fonts and excessive spacing to meet the writing criteria . <p> If you are given a writing assignment with a page number , the best thing to do is go directly to the person who made the assignment and ask for a word count . This will take away all the variations and help ensure your writing assignment meets expectations . If its for something informal and you simply need a general guideline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages is <p> The below list is an approximation , and actual pages will differ depending on a number of factors mentioned earlier in this article . Use the below information for a general reference , but do n't  assume it will be the case at all times . Here are basic word to pages conversions : <p> We do our best to continually update word counter to provide new tools the users request . One of the most common emails we get is from users who have lost something that they have written , and they 're hoping we have a copy of it so that its not completely lost . In response to this , we added a function to the word counter that will leave the words you have written in the word counter text area unless you specifically deleted them from the site . <p> To do this , we use a cookie on your computer and is not saved anywhere on the website meaning only you can access the article again . This has helped a number of users regain articles they thought they had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few emails from people who have cleared their writing before leaving the website , and when these people need the article they wrote , there is nothing we can do to help them . Anyone who has lost an article knows that feeling , so we wanted to give users the option of having their writing saved a bit better . Its with this in mind we have created the option to sign into the website through Facebook . <p> For those who sign into the website through Facebook , theyll now have an autosave for what they write . When signed in , a " Revision " drop-down tab will appear at the top right of the word counter tool . This will save anything you have been writing in word counter every minute for 60 revisions ( it will only make a new revision if there is a change to what you have written into the word counter box in the last minute ) . That means if your computer crashes , the window closes , or even if you clear the page , you still can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in the recent past . <p> In order to do this , what you write is saved onto our servers . Since your writing is linked to your Facebook account , no other users will be able to see what you write . Since the writing is being saved , technically the site admins ( there are two of us ) can see what you have written , but we do n't  do this . We have no interest in what you 're writing and were far too busy on other projects to be looking through that information . Your work is yours and we will never use it or sell it . We have simply implemented this save option so we can decrease the number of emails we get where users have lost their writing . If you absolutely want to make sure nobody can see what you have been writing , then you should n't use the Facebook sign-in option . <p> Its important to note that this tool should not be used to replace saving your writing on your own computer and backups that you usually make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have otherwise accidentally been lost . There is no long-term storage of the article and after every 60 revisions you make , the writing will disappear . This method also is n't foolproof , and its still possible a technical glitch could happen where revisions are n't  saved properly , so you should n't rely on this as your only method to save your work . It is , however , another layer that may help you recover your writing if something unexpected should happen . <p> This word counter tool originally counted words , characters , and letters . As more people found it , we started to get requests of what the users would like to see added to the tool . Over the years , we have added many of these suggestions . We continue to strive to keep this tool updated and to add new features which users have requested which make word counter more beneficial to all . We recently added the following features which you can now use : <h> Spell and Grammar Check <p> We 've added a button to the top left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have finished writing , you can click this button and a spell and grammar check will be performed on what you have written and will highlight areas of the writing that may be grammatically incorrect or have spelling issues . Its important to note that this should n't be exclusively relied upon , and as with all writing , you should proofread what you have written , but it may catch some minor errors you missed or show you an area of your writing which may be able to be more clearly rewritten . <h> Different Cases <p> There may be instances where you want to have your writing ( or certain portions of your writing ) displayed in a certain way . The " Case " button just to the right of the " Spell Check " button gives you four options to display your writing in different ways . There are two ways to use this . You can highlight a certain portion of your writing , and only the highlighted portion will be affected by your choice . For example , if you highlight your first paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph will be turned to upper case and the rest of the writing will remain as it was . If you choose one of the options without highlighting any of your writing , the entire writing will be formatted by the choice you made . The four choices available are : <p> Lowercase : when you choose this option , all writing will be displayed in lowercase like this . even after periods , the letters will all be in lowercase . <p> Title Case : Also referred to as title capitalization , this gives the proper way to capitalize titles for your writing , articles and blog posts . It can often get confusing which words should and should n't be capitalized in the title of the paper , and by choosing this option , it will automatically give you the correct way to display it . For example , the title of this article , " Title capitalization , spell check and more new word counter tools " gets transformed to " Title Capitalization , Spell Check and More New Word Counter Tools " when the title case option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn all the writing to a typical sentence construction . This can be convenient if you happen to forget to capitalize after periods , or if you tried some of the other case options , but decide you want to back to normal . <h> Reading Level <p> On the right side under " Details " , there is now a section at the bottom that displays Reading Level . The reading level is calculated by using the Dale " Chall readability formula based on 3,000 common words fourth graders understand . This can be useful if you 're writing to a certain age group to make sure your writing is n't above or below their level . <h> Keyword Density Options <p> Under " Options " ( top right corner ) you can now choose the number of keywords you want displayed for keyword density . The default has been 10 words , but you can choose as few or as many as you wish to fit the particular type of writing you 're doing . <p> If there are other tools youd like to see added to word counter , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We try to continue to add and update WordCounter.net with things the users would find beneficial . 
@@12747108 @1347108/ <h> The Best Words to Describe " Love " <p> Love has been described as " A Many Splendored Thing " in poems ( William Waterway ) , in films ( 1955 ) , and in Academy Award winning songs ( lyrics Paul Francis Webster ) . The same descriptive phrase has been used for a TV soap opera . <p> " A Many Splendored Thing " originated in a poem by late 19th century poet , Francis Thompson . He was English , so he probably included a " u " in " splendoured " when he coined the phrase in The Hound of Heaven as he spent 182 lines investigating Christianity and Gods search for a missing soul . This would , of course , be 182 lines of words describing the concept of divine love . However , the phrase that has outlived him is n't really a conclusive description . Its rather a cop-out . <p> In the 1970 movie " Love Story " Erich Segal used the phrase " Love means never having to say you 're sorry , " and at about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market featuring drawn outlines of a girl and boy , and sugar sweet " Love Is " statements . <h> The Search for the Best Words for Love <p> People have been looking for the best words to describe love for years , centuries , and perhaps for millennia . Perhaps they have been searching since the days when cavemen began grabbing cavewomen by the hair before dragging them into the cave as a mark of affection . It would have made sense for them to start considering something other than grunts to describe those feelings they were experiencing . Dragging someone by the hair could be hard work , and grunts could be misunderstood . A cliche or two could save a lot of effort . <p> Fairy tales , poets , Hollywood movies and Internet sites followed centuries later , finding thousands , if not tens of thousands of ways to continue the quest for the best words to describe love . The very fact they kept coming up with new ones indicates its not easy and the best , and most conclusive , description has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone who can come up with a definitive answer will have discovered something important . It might have more impact than any other scientific discoveries which have earned experts Nobel Prizes over the years . This could happen because it would influence peoples everyday lives and relationships in a way that could change the world . At least then people might have a real reference point when trying to explain love . <p> As the situation stands now , there are no words , best or otherwise , that will describe love in a way that will satisfy everyone . There is n't a phrase that will give everyone a lightbulb moment and a reason to respond , " That 's it ! Now I know what love is . Now I can love , be loved and , maybe , be in love . " <h> Parts of Many Speeches <p> Its no wonder its so difficult . The word " love " forms parts of many types of speech . It can be a noun ( or naming word ) for a series of sensations , feelings and emotions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " when it comes to experiencing it . In addition , love also functions as a noun modifier in " love affair , " an adjective in " loving relationship " and an adverb in " He looked at her lovingly . " <p> Further complicating the idea of describing love in words is the fact that there are so many different types of love . As if it is n't already impossible to describe the love experience in words , we are expected to find more words , more adjectives , adverbs and other nouns , to attach to that indescribable concept . This will break it down into categories that are more specific , but probably even harder to describe . <h> Adding to the Confusion <p> As a result , the following words , and more , are tossed in : unconditional and conditional , free , passionate , romantic , selfless and self , playful , divine , maternal and paternal , brotherly and sisterly , eternal and endless . Its supposed to help if we add these to the word we find hardest to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the unmeasurable more manageable by separating it into smaller categories . <p> The effect it has , however , is to set up a lot more puzzles and challenges . Now we have not only one concept to describe , and to understand , but several . Perhaps once we have come up with the best words to describe unconditional , or even maternal love , we can return to describing romantic love . Then we can hopefully , get closer to understanding the wonderful , scary , passionate and all-consuming experience that is love . It is , indeed , a " many splendored thing " but its also sometimes a many pitfalled thing . It can make you the happiest person around , particularly if you experience it as a verb of doing and experiencing . It can also break your heart if you keep falling in and out of the love noun . <h> Words that Describe Love <p> For those who are simply looking for a list of words that describe love , or make reference to it , here are some of the most popular :

If we were to go around quoting Shakespeare , people would think us pretentious or would they ? <p> The truth is that Shakespeare was the HBO of the times . He wrote entertaining plays for the masses and played on themes such as sex , murder , mystery , magic and politics . His work was the 17th century equivalent of " Game of Thrones , " except that the girls werent as gorgeous because the morals of the times forbade women from treading the boards as thespians . Yes , " thespians . " Look it up if you must ! <p> I can just hear people discussing the latest play , <p> " Didst thou see the latest play by Shakespeare ?

I had no idea what I was expected to write , but this gives me a good word count estimate to shoot for . Thanks <p> In actual sense , all this does n't  matter . You can chage things to make the pages different depending on the number of words . Its all an estimate and not a solid answer that can be applied for everything . <p> The OP states that these are estimates . Just because an estimate wont be exactly right does n't  mean it is n't useful . People use estimates all the time to help them . For those who are looking for a basic rough idea , this is helpful . <p> Things were so much easier back in the day when you could know exactly how many pages 500 words would be . Now that its so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can change he margins , increase the font point size or just choose a font that fits me needs for space . Pages are useless these days . That is why almost al assignments are done with word counts . Everyone knows how easy it is to manipulate pages that its the only way to ensure assignments are done correctly . <p> What am I supposed to do if I write 1000 words , but it does n't  make the number of pages I want ? I do n't  think I should have to write more words just because mine happen to be shorter than my classmates . We both wrote the same number of words , his are just longer so it takes up more pages . That means people who write long words have an advantage even though long words are n't  always good to use . <p> Is this really something that 's worth complaining about ? The important issue is to write the best essay you can , not the length of words . If you 're focus in only on the words and not what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Focus on what 's important , not on things like this . <p> Can someone explain to me why so many people are obsessed with word count and page count ? If you 're a writer , shouldnt writing well be the most important thing ? Why do writers seem to obsess over word count and page count ? I just do n't  understand it . <p> Many authors use word count as a motivational tool . To help them from getting stuck and editing each sentence over and over again as they write , they choose a minimum number of words they want to write each day . These words may not be perfect and will likely need to be heavily edited , but it gets the ideas down and keeps them from getting stuck on one area of their book . Its a way to motivate them to get the book done . It works well for me , but I know others who do n't  do well with it . I think it depends a lot on your personality , but forcing myself to be consistent day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without a daily word count , I would never complete them . <p> Depending on the genre of book you are writing , word count can be critical in whether or not your writing can actually be published . Publishers like certain genres to be within certain word counts , so any author who hopes to be published has to create their works within these counts . <p> How many words is a page if the lines are 1.5 spaced ? I have a teacher who insists all our essays be spaces 1.5 ( not single and not double ) and there is no information on this . If I write 1000 words , how much would that be 1.5 spaced ? <p> Do you know what fonts have the widest spacing so that they fill up the page more quickly ? I need to find a wide font so I do n't  have to write as many words to fill up the pages on my assignment . If you can send me in the direction of the best wide font to do this , that would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Everyone should just know that 1 page = 500 words . If we could all just agree to that , life would be so much simpler . You have a standard for measurements , you have a standard for time , we should have a standard for the number of words that constitutes a single page . Its ridiculous that 300 words is a page for one person and 700 words is a page for another person . <p> Who is ever going to read 2000 pages ? And if you really wanted to know , you could do the calculations to figure it out . Its not that difficult . It would be 500,000 words if the pages are doubled spaced , and it would be 1 million words if the pages are single spaced . All you have to do is a little math to figure that out . <p> I am confused . Why isnt the page size factor considered here ? Every factor is considered and it is okay but the page numbers also largely vary with respect to the font , font size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of any version can be made portrait or the landscape-sized , page can be narrowed or broadened .. These all are under the menu " page layout " in the word and under " margins , orientation , size " <p> If standard size is taken as A4 size then it would be easy for understanding all these . Thanks ! <p> I find these estimates to be off . I write longer words than most , so most of my pages have less words than the estimates on this page . They are off . You should change them so they are more accurate for people who use longer vocabulary words . <p> They are estimates . Of course there are many factors which will make pages longer or shorter than the estimates provided here . These are n't  absolutes , but general rules of thumb to give you a guestimate . <p> Why is everything word count these days instead of page count ? Page count is so much easier . When I was in school when I was younger , all assignments were page count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . Now its all about words and number of words . Its so much more complicated . <p> Page count was great when there were only typewriters and each page was basically the same , but now its easy to manipulate page count by changing font size and fonts . You can also adjust margins with a computer . Word count is just a lot more accurate . <p> I have a writing assignment in school , and it is always helpful to know how many pages I will need . I think that since teachers do n't  give page assignments but only word count assignments , its difficult to imagine how many pages that will be . <p> The reason that teachers do n't  assign a number of pages anymore is because its too easy to manipulate pages . When students used to write on typewriters , it was common for teachers to assign essays in number of pages . With the adoption of computers in the classroom , teachers switched from pages to work count because it was too easy for the computers to manipulate the font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teachers get a more accurate length of essay than they would if they assigned homework by pages . <p> What if you hand write your pages ? I do n't  like writing rough drafts on the computer , so I do it by hand . How many words will be on my hand written pages ? I use a standard 11 x 8.5 inch notebook paper single spaced . <p> This would depend heavily on how big/small you write . its like different fonts take up different amount of space on a page , so does your specific handwriting . The best way to know your per page word count would be to look at past pages and count the number of words you write for each page . its time consuming , but any other estimate is bound not to be accurate since its so dependent on your handwriting . <p> Do teachers really count the number of words when an assignment is given ? They do n't  actually count each individual word , so can I just make up a number of words for each page and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I agree that there are a lot of people who are overly concerned with word count , but there are legitimate reasons to keep it in mind as well . @Daniel gives a good example . I would n't worry about it too much . If its not something important to you and your writing , you can ignore it . <p> My teacher told me that I needed to write an essay that had 2500 words . I wrote an essay which had 2498 words . I got marks off for not writing an essay with exactly 2500 words . That 's completely ridiculous but my teacher refuse to reinstate the point she took off because she said 2500 words and not 2498 words . I couldve just said that my was 2500 words and she wouldve never known the difference . I do n't  understand why I 'm being punished for being honest .

Someone might be good at it , but it is n't artful writing except possibly in the subset of business writing . Nobody would ever confuse a business proposal as written art . <p> I do n't  believe that writing gets the credit it deserves for being an art . People have the misconception that writing is easy , probably because everybody has to learn to write at some point in their life . But to bring words to life is an art . There 's no two ways about it . In fact , good writing will allow you to see pictures in your mind which is the definition of art .

Sometimes , we forget to mention things we actually know , and because we omit these points , we lose marks . What a waste ! <h> Remembering in the Correct Order <p> Sometimes , we not only have to remember a whole lot of things , but we also have to remember them in the right order . For example , if we are asked to list the planets of the solar system from the nearest to the sun to the furthest , we have to remember that Mercury is the closest , followed by Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and Pluto ( even though its no longer a planet , but that 's another discussion ) . <p> Thats nine things to remember in the correct order !

" <p> In the exam room , you simply use your rough work paper to jot down the first letter of every word , and from there , its easy to get 100% for that question . <h> Remember Keywords for Longer Answers <p> Essay questions can be challenging , and your teachers will be looking for several points in your answer . If you have mnemonics to help you , you 'll be able to remember all the information you should cover . How can you describe the topics you need to discuss using only one word ? Clearly , you need to pick out a keyword that will tell you what to write about in each paragraph . <p> As an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a common mnemonic that works for that .

Most of us know the days of the week and the months of the year are capitalized , but what about the seasons ? Many people have to stop and think if they 're supposed to capitalize winter , spring , summer and fall ( or autumn ) . Its the same problem people often have with whether or not to capitalize directions . As with the case of north , south , east and west , the answer is the same . The general rule of thumb is that you capitalize the seasons if they happen to be part of a proper name , but not if they 're merely indicating the time of the year . While there are some caveats to this , its the general rule of thumb to follow . <h> Capitalizing Seasons <p> As mentioned above , the rule for capitalizing seasons is you do when they are part of a proper noun . The truth is you 'll seldom see or use the capitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics are both examples of the capitalized form , and using the capital is correct because the season the event happens in is part of its proper name . Proper names get capitals , so the season , as part of the name , will get a capital letter as well . <p> Capitalizing is also in order when a season becomes personified . For example , take the sentence , " Bringing all her glory with her Spring is the handmaiden of Summer . " In this sentence , the seasons are being talked about as if they were people , and peoples names always get a capital letter . <p> Of course , the same would be true if a person happened to have the name of one of the seasons .

As might be expected , there are those who disagree . They argue that the seasons are similar to the months of the year , and in the same way they should always get the capital letter . The good news is most people who hold this point of view agree that using the lower case is currently the accepted form they just happen to believe that it is n't quite right . <p> The above should make it pretty clear when you do and when you do n't  capitalize the seasons when writing . Now you have the knowledge to help others who are n't  sure when they should and shouldnt capitalize the seasons , and you should even be able to clearly explain the reason why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not unless winter is part of a proper name . <p> Do you capitalize summer ?

If it does n't  like the word you used , it points it out to you , and in a couple of clicks , its all fixed up . But just how much can we trust spell checkers ? Speaking from experience , not very much ! Sure , its handy when you 've just made a little typo , but it has fatal drawbacks that can see you submitting work with confidence only for it to be ripped apart by your reader or teacher . Here are 10 reasons why careful proofreading is the only solution if you want to submit correct work . <h> It Wont Identify Homophones <p> There are pairs of words that mean different things and are spelled differently , but do n't  mean the same thing . Here are a few examples : <p> There and their : A lot of people struggle with this one ! <p> They 're and there : Brits are particularly prone to confuse these two ! <p> Air and heir : Well , they sound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I saw a hair salon in Sweden called " Curl up and Dye , " cute as a play on words , but not as an error . <p> Effect and affect : Confusing these words is one of the most common errors among English speakers . Get it right ! <h> It Wont Identify Misspelled Words That Are Real Words <p> I have a lot of fun collecting these words . They can be hilarious or simply embarrassing . For example : <p> Best and beast : The beast doctor in town Could it be a veterinarian ? Or is it something more sinister ? <p> Retards and regards : I had this one from a friend of mine . Its probably not the best way to sign off a business letter . <p> Human resources and inhuman resources : There was meant to be a space in the second example . <p> Singing and sinning . Of course , you could possibly sing while you sin , but it would be unusual . <h> Your Grammar Could Be Awful <p> Although spell check will occasionally pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things it thinks are wrong are actually right . For example , Microsoft Word does n't  like " your " in the sentence to follow . It suggests " you 're , but it is mistaken : <p> " Youre incomplete or tangled sentences get the green light from spell check , but later on , they make you cringe with embarrassment . If only you 'd done a more careful proofread instead of trusting spell check ! " <p> " Youre , " oh dear ! That 's a blooper from spell check right there ! <h> Editing Helps You Learn Your Errors <p> I so often type " form " instead of " from , " that I know I need to check my work carefully when this word is involved . Its all too easy for ones eyes to slide right over that error . After all , the letters are all there , they 're just not in the right place . Now that I know I often tangle my fingers over the word , I know I have to check it carefully . <h> You Begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're stumped as to why the word keeps coming up as being misspelled makes you super-lazy . Always try to correct words without spell checks help to begin with , and if you still cant get it right , see what spell check suggests .

It really has helped me to improve my spelling ! <h> You Wont Be Able to Write Quickly When You Need To <p> Pictures this : you 're in a skype interview with someone you hope to impress . You cant wander off to check your spelling every few seconds as you quickly type . Bam ! Bam ! Bam ! The person on the other end wants a quick response . Make too many spelling errors , and you end up looking like a hopeless incompetent . Impressive ? Hardly ! <h> It Does n't  Know Your Terminology <p> Terminology lurks in every field , and accepted spellings do n't  always agree with spell check . For example , most people these days refer to " startups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the term . A few months ago , it suggested " start-ups " as the right spelling . Medical terminology and other scientific jargon often does n't  feature , and pitfalls lurk behind every terminology-laden sentence . <h> It Has No Idea What You Really Mean <p> Writing conveys meaning , but spell check has no notion of meaning . You can say " infection " instead of " affection " and have your writing end up looking kind of scary . Or you can emulate my friend and sign off your covering letter with a cheery " Kind retards . " Only you can know what you actually meant , so do n't  trust your software too much . <h> It Does n't  Always Spot Words Accidentally Split With a Space <p> As long as both words are real words on their own , spell check acts dumb . Why ? Because its rather dumb ! Check these words out : <p> All ways versus always <p> Some times versus sometimes <p> In stead versus instead <p> Never the less instead of nevertheless <p> Sun day versus Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever replace the human mind . Ive tried grammar checkers , spell checkers , and style checkers , and they are all only tools that can be used wisely in the hands of an informed human being . Just as no machine can write properly for you , spell checkers and grammar checkers will always be less intelligent than your own proofreading. <h> 4 comments <p> Its painfully obvious when students use only spell check and grammar check and do n't  actually proofread their essays . Technology is great and can help students write better , but only if they do the basics as well . If they only rely on the technology and not rereading their writing , its going to end up worse . It used to be that students had to reread and proofread their essays because there was no other way to check it . In some ways , essays are getting worse because spell check makes them lazier.

Instead , were talking about words that give you a feeling of real disgust . They 're perfectly ordinary , **27;207;TOOLONG words , but researchers have found when study participants are asked to rate words based on their gut-reaction , these words are consistently rated as being the most hated ones . <h> A Lot of People Hate the Word " Moist " <p> Paul Thibodeau , a psychology professor , authored a study based on the way 2,500 people reacted to words , and " moist " was generally considered to be downright nasty . Its possible the reaction would have been different if he included it in a phrase like " moist chocolate cake , " but when viewed on its own , it was seen as being absolutely disgusting by 25 percent of the group . <p> Words using similar sounds did n't  get the thumbs down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . So , what 's the problem with " moist ? " <p> Professor Thibodeau thinks it may be the association between " moist " and bodily functions . " Vomit " and " phlegm " were also rated as being among the most-hated , so he joined the dots and decided that words related to bodily fluids were the pits . <h> A Linguistics Professor and a Neurologist Blame Sounds <p> Professor Jason Riggle and Dr. David Eagleman , a neuroscientist , think that word aversion comes from the sounds themselves . Just as we feel odd after hearing a jarring sound in music , certain word-sounds are unpleasant to us . Dr. Eagleman has done his own experiments using made-up words and found that people did n't  like unusual sound combinations . So , if we think a word sounds funny , were more likely to associate it with something unpleasant . <h> Associations or Sounds : Who Is Right ? <p> I 'm going to sit on the fence with this one . Associations really can make a word disgusting . Take " vomit " for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word itself is probably innocent enough , but the association is utterly gross ! <p> At the same time , I can believe that sounds that do n't  fit our ideas of harmony would also be jarring . Unlike Dr. Eagleman , I 've never invented a truly disgusting word , and I would n't know where to begin , but it makes sense in a way . <p> I 'd say both reasons for being disgusted by words are valid . What do you think ? <h> Is This Useful Knowledge ? <p> Oddly enough , I think this knowledge could be useful , particularly in the marketing world . When we send out marketing messages , we need to be very careful in our word choices . We might even want to disgust our audience before offering them a calming , soothing message that explains how to solve a problem . Alternatively , we might want to avoid any negative associations whatsoever . <p> Still , just because of chocolate cake , I 'm not altogether convinced about the gut-churning effects of the word " moist . " Couple it with cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it just me who thinks so ? Of course , being covered with moist sweat sounds a whole lot less delicious , so I think we need to add context before we can talk about word aversion . <p> Made-up words are two-a-penny . Just look at company names and brand names , and you 're sure to find at least a few invented words . If we could know what sounds or combinations of sounds give people that " Eeeyew ! " feeling of disgust , and which ones make them feel great , it could surely help companies with their branding strategies . <h> Is It OK to Hate Words ? <p> Ive read commentary about how silly it is to hate words , but whether its silly or not , it seems to be a real enough phenomenon . But to play devils advocate , we need negative words as much as we need positive ones . After all , if you want to describe something gross , having some unpleasant-sounding words or ones with less-than-charming associations , is mighty handy ! <p> I use " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam room , vomited out a whole lot of information , and scored an A ! " The word " regurgitated " is interchangeable here , or you could use it to indicate your disgust , " He just regurgitated the same old information we always hear on that subject ! " <p> Of course , some people react more strongly to word aversion than others do , and I put it down to sensitivity or possibly a very active imagination . Neither of these things is bad to have , although they might make your life a little more interesting than it needs to be . <h> What Words Do You Hate and Why ? <p> First , a few ground-rules . Well just assume that anything obscene or scatological is gross , so those words are out of bounds .

Nothing about it is nice ! <p> Maggot . The word itself may not be to blame , but the associations are there ! <p> To be honest , I do n't  think there are any words that I hate in the truest sense of the word , but these would certainly top my list of the words I do n't  like all that much . <h> Top Words People Hate <p> For those looking for a top list of words people hate , here are some words to consider :

As I 'm sure you 've guessed , words are made up of symbols ( the alphabet ) , but words also have a deep symbolic significance in themselves . Even your name is symbol that represents your identity ! <p> Words can be symbols all on their own , or they can be combined to create symbolism . So how are words used as symbols ? Here are some examples of specific words as symbols <h> Colors <p> Colors , and the words we use to define them are highly symbolic . <p> " He wore purple . " Purple is associated with royalty and has been since Roman times . Originally , this happened because purple dye was so expensive that only the very wealthy could afford it .

For example , " When he behaved so badly , it was a big red flag for me . " <h> Miscellaneous Examples <p> Our ability to equate words with associations has led to everything from flowers to times of the day and directions being used as symbols . <p> " She chose the left-hand path .

" In this example , roses refer to easy living with everything being beautiful and positive . But as we know , every rose has a thorn . <p> " Its your baby ! " A baby symbolizes responsibility , and no wonder ! But it also symbolizes immaturity , helplessness or weakness . For example , " Do n't  be a baby ! " <p> " It was the dawn of a new era , " or " It suddenly dawned on me ! " Dawn or sunrise represent something new . <p> " In your twilight years , you want peace of mind .

Although we 've looked at words being used symbolically , Nietzsche contended that all words are symbols , and if you think about it , he was absolutely right ! A word is just a collection of syllables , but when we hear it , all sorts of ideas and associations come flooding into our minds . <p> These can be quite subjective .

For example , if you had a happy childhood , the word " mother " brings along all kinds of positive associations , but for some- people , it just cant have the same effect , even when they understand the broader cultural context . <p> It would be impossible to show you an example of the way we use all words as symbols other than to say this entire article is a combination of symbols intended to convey a set of ideas .

I 'm willing to accept perfectly intelligent people are capable of little language vices , but not everyone has my forbearance , and your teachers ( and maybe your bosses ) are likely to pick up your mistake if you confuse these two words . It just makes you look a bit less intelligent than you really are when you mix them up .

Sometimes , it can be a verb , but it is seldom used in this way . Take a look at these examples : <p> We will need to change peoples attitudes if we hope to effect change . <p> I hope to effect an upgrade in my standard of living . <p> In these examples , " effect " is an action that causes a consequence . You can remember the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that to be " affected " by something is the passive result of something else happening , while " effecting " something is an action in itself . <h> Cheats and Shortcuts <p> If you find that a bit hard to remember , just use " effect " as a noun .

For instance : <p> the effect . <p> the negative ( or positive ) effect . <p> the powerful effect . <p> All of these come from our examples , and we can see that they make some kind of sense , but now try putting " the " where " affect " is the correct word . <p> hard drugs the affect a persons <p> that were the affected by the heavy rain . <p> .. he was the affected by <p> It does n't  make sense , does it ?

For the 1% of the time that " effect " is a verb , remembering the active role it plays will answer the question . <p> Another way of remembering it is to remember that " a " comes first in the alphabet .

Now , most of us are n't  comfortable with foreign habits and mores , and the meaning of the word " uncouth " began to morph into a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually fell out of common usage , became archaic , and was forgotten altogether . <h> Uncouth and a Joke <p> By the time people got around to writing full English dictionaries , only one word remained , " uncouth . " Now usually , a word featuring an " un " is attached to another word , and the prefix makes it mean the opposite thing , but " uncouth " was a peculiar anomaly because " couth " was n't an accepted word at all , at least , not in modern parlance . <p> It seems most likely that introducing " couth " as a word describing someone with good manners , initially started out as a joke . " Havent you got no couth ? " someone would ask before dissolving into gales of laughter at their own wit . It could even be that people looking for an impressive-sounding word for " good manners " decided that " couth " was the logical opposite of " uncouth . " If they did , people would have laughed at their ignorance because they were all too palpably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny thing . Whether as a joke or not , the word " couth " began to be used more and more in its new context . It still was n't completely accepted , but it was a word people used , and words people use become part of the language . Its the natural order of things . The average English speaker from a few hundred years ago probably would n't understand half of what we say , while we would certainly struggle to understand him . That 's because words and word usages keep changing all the time . <p> Not all that long ago , you would n't have found the word " couth " in any dictionary , but today , you 'll find it in quite a few . Some will note it has a " humorous " origin , while others appear to take it perfectly seriously . But there are still dictionaries that do n't  contain the word at all and do n't  accept it as a proper English word . Who is right ? <h> So , Is Couth a Real Word ? <p> " Couth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't universally accepted at this time . It is by no means the only English word to be formed from a mistaken assumption . A source I looked at pointed out that " burgle " was only coined in the 19th century on the assumption that " burgling " is what a burglar does . Today , its 100% acceptable as a word , but I think we need to be a bit cautious with our couth . Its still a little bit on the new side of acceptable . <h> Will Couth Become a Real Word ? <p> We do n't  know . It may fall into disuse and join its predecessor form of " couth " in the archives of little known and seldom remembered language , or it might stick , and become a perfectly serious word that is much quicker and easier to type or say than " well-mannered . " Who will decide ? The popular vote of course . How do we vote for a word ? By using it when we speak and write . For now , I would recommend using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including it in any formal essays or reports , at least for the present . After all , you would n't want to end up in a heated argument with a teacher who subscribes to the idea that " couth " just does n't  cut it as a word , and that it was uncouth , or at least ignorant , of you to include it in your essay . <h> 5 comments <p> Couth is not a word . The types of dictionaries that list it as a word are n't  real dictionaries they are Internet or slang dictionaries . I 've never seen couth used in any type of writing where it would be considered a word . <p> If people use couth , then its a word . The fact that there are some dictionaries that include it just verifies this . it does n't  matter if they are n't  the dictionaries you deem as " good " English is a living language and is always changing . People use couth and people understand its meaning , its a word . 
@@12747126 @1347126/ <h> What Is a Paradox ? <p> If you have two pet dogs , you have a paradox ( pair of dogs ) . Groan ! Alright , alright , I 'll stop trying to be punny , and I 'll take this question a little more seriously . Simply put , a paradox is a statement that seems to contradict itself , but could very well be true . I adore paradoxes because they often make you do a double-take after you read the words . <h> Examples of Paradox <p> here 's an example of a paradox . Someone says , " I 'm a compulsive liar , you know . " That 's an interesting piece of information . Do you believe someone who says that ? If someone is a compulsive liar , they wo n't tell the truth unless they absolutely have to . So , if they say they are a compulsive liar , is that a lie unto itself meaning that they really are n't  a compulsive liar ? I 'm going to stop even thinking about that one because my brain might go into a continuous loop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ! <h> Literary Pardoxes <p> Sometimes , paradoxes are used in literature to make us think about something . For example , in George Orwells book , Animal Farm , the ruling animals tell us , " All animals are equal , but some are more equal than others . " In the story , the farm animals overthrow the farmer and take over the farm in order to be " equal , " but ultimately , a few of them end up with all the power . This allegorical story and the quote we just looked at illustrate the paradox of so-called social equality . We can claim it exists , but there will always be those who have an advantage over others . <p> Have you ever heard the paradoxical saying " I must be cruel to be kind ? " Sure you have ! What you probably did n't  know was that this saying is one of the many lines we 've borrowed from Shakespeares plays to use in everyday language . Although it sounds like a contradiction in terms , it really can be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in order to help them . <h> Oxymorons as Paradoxes <p> No ! Do n't  run away ! There 's nothing complicated about oxymorons , they 're simply words or phrases that contain a contradiction in terms . For instance , " bittersweet " is an oxymoron , and its also a paradox . <p> A crash landing is also a paradox if you think about it . Surely , you either crash or you land . How can you do both ? Nevertheless , we know the meaning of the term even though it seems to defy logic . The same goes for a near miss . If you nearly missed something , you must have missed it , right ? But this term is used to indicate a near hit ! <p> How about an escaped prisoner ? If someone has escaped , they are surely no longer a prisoner , at least for the time being . But instead of even thinking about how illogical this word combination is , we rush to lock all our doors if we hear that an escaped prisoner has been spotted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who say that " military intelligence " is an oxymoron , but I wont risk annoying the armed forces by agreeing with that , at least , not in public . <h> Everyday Paradoxes <p> Were confronted by paradoxes every day of our lives . How often have you seen an advertisement that says " Buy now and save ! " ? That 's a paradox . If you buy , you spend , and if you spend , you 're not saving . We know that they really mean you 'll pay less than you otherwise would . <p> Have you heard about " fighting for peace ? " It seems like a crazy idea . As long as you 're fighting , you 're making war , not peace ! However , if you are fighting against an army or organization that has caused a lot of unrest around the world , you really could be fighting for peace , paradoxical as it may sound . <p> When you discuss a hilarious comedy , you might tell your friends it was seriously funny . Paradox ! But it does n't  confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy in the expectation of a really good laugh . <p> Do you like seafood ? Next time you order up a plate of jumbo shrimp , remember to give the paradox a little acknowledgment . Shrimps are pretty small , in fact , they 're famous for it . But jumbo shrimps are , at least , bigger than other shrimps , even if they are still quite small . <p> I could go on we can call somebody a " nobody . " We might " act naturally " when were playing a hoax on someone , or we might remind someone that " less is more . " Look out for everyday paradoxes ; you 'll come across more of them than you ever expected . <h> Scientific Paradoxes <p> Did you know it takes more hot water to make cold water hot than it takes cold water to make hot water cold ? It really does . That 's why we run the hot water first when filling a bathtub . This is a very simple paradox , and there is an easily understandable reason for it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in astrophysics , quantum mechanics , biology , chemistry , linguistics , and even mathematics . No matter what field you study , you will come across paradoxes to boggle your mind and make life seem just a bit weirder and more wonderful .

At school , we were taught you should never , ever , under any circumstances start a sentence with a conjunction . That rules out starting sentences with either " and " or " but " when writing . I faithfully learned the rule . I became positively angry when I read books in which otherwise excellent writers seemed to make this faux pas . How could they be so sloppy ? <p> One day , I decided to settle the matter once and for all . I would find an authoritative reference to back up what I had learned , and I would send it to someone who had just argued you can start a sentence with " but . " <h> Being Wrong Can Make You Happy <p> Once I started to check , I quickly realized I was going to be proved wrong . People , including some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting sentences with " and " and " but " for hundreds of years . Of course , there are style guides that discourage it , but its perfectly acceptable to begin a sentence with " but " when writing . I was thrilled ! That very day , I started peppering my writing with sentences starting with conjunctions . But one shouldnt go overboard ! See what I did there ? Hah ! <p> Using any stylistic quirk too frequently spoils your writing . By all means , start sentences with " but " from time to time , but remember that " but " also belongs after a comma . I did it again , did n't  I ? <h> When Should You Consider Starting a Sentence With " But " ? <p> " Contrary to what your high school English teacher told you , there 's no reason not to begin a sentence with but or and ; in fact , these words often make a sentence more forceful and graceful . They are almost always better than beginning with however or additionally . " ( Professor Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey ) <p> Thank you , professor ! I 'll admit to using " however , " but being lazy , I really do prefer the word " but " to begin a sentence when given a choice . " Additionally " is just awful , and I flinch every time I start a sentence with it . It seems so pompous ! <p> The professor also confirms starting with the conjunction can make your writing more forceful . Remember , you do n't  always want to be forceful . Sometimes sentence flow is more appropriate . But a choppy " but " at the start of a sentence certainly does seem to add emphasis when that 's what you 're looking for . <h> People Are Going to Argue This With You <p> Just as I once was a firm believer in the " never start a sentence with and or but " non-rule , you 'll come across enslaved souls who have been taught the very same non-rule . Where can they turn for confirmation and comfort ? The Bible is always a good place . Refer them to Genesis Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a sentence starting with " but , " you may have to read a little further all the way to Genesis 8:1 : " But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark , and he sent a wind over the earth , and the waters receded . " <p> Looking around online , I see some arguing that using the Bible as a work of English literature is pushing the envelope . I beg to differ , but perhaps as the worlds greatest bestseller , its a bit too commercial for them . Let 's take them to the real authority : the notoriously stuffy and pedantic , Fowlers Modern English Usage . Its seen as the authoritative book on English Grammar , and if they wo n't believe it , they 're never going to believe anyone . <p> If they 're trying to find a comeback , you can always help them out .

@@12747129 @1347129/ <h> Word Count List How Many Words Your Text Should Have <p> Think word count is n't important in writing ? Well , think again . As a writer , the number of words in a piece matters a great deal ; it is the only measure of productivity you have . Therefore , you need to ensure the number is within what 's expected for your genre and category . So how many words should your text have ? Let 's take a comprehensive look at word count list , and find out how it all works . <h> A good average sentence length <p> There 's no perfect length , however , a well-written sentence should have 15-20 words on average . Using simple and short sentences will help more people to understand your content . But restrain from using uniform sentence lengths if you do n't want your writings to be choppy and without flow . Though there 's the possibility of long structured sentences being balanced and readable , comprehension often drops and readers may struggle to understand the whole content . People expect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't have the time to slow down to deconstruct the long , complicated sentences and contemplate the clauses . By making it simple , it shows you respect your content reader 's time and interest . <h> How many words in a paragraph ? <p> As you can expect , there is no fixed number of words that a paragraph should have . A rule of thumb : the paragraphs are usually about 100 to 200 words long , which is about 6-8 sentences . Nevertheless , it all depends on the ideas , and ideas come in many sizes . So the paragraph can be long enough to reach its end . But we ca n't ignore the fact that readers do n't like seeing blocks of paragraphs . And it 's for that reason you should stick to one concept or idea per paragraph to avoid creating very long paragraphs . Simply shift to a new paragraph when you shift to a new concept/idea . <h> How many words in an essay ? <p> A standard essay must be a minimum of 3-5 paragraphs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs , there 's no point sticking to this extremely limiting rule . This is handy in academic writing , where your paragraphs are expected to be longer than most essays . On average , there are 100 to 200 words in a paragraph . And as a general rule with essays , you 'll have an introduction , body , and conclusion . So you can assume that a 1500-word essay will likely to have about 5-8 paragraphs . Remember your essay will be evaluated on the content you present , not the number of paragraphs . <h> How long should a book be ? <p> Though the length of your book is determined by the details needed to make it good , it is important to adhere to the expected word count in your genre and category . It demonstrates how well you understand your market . And in line with this , here are the industry norms worth knowing . <p> Under 500 words is generally considered flash fiction <p> A short story : 1,000-8,000 words <p> Novella Story : 10,000-40,000 words <h> Novel <p> A 40,000-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be eligible for finisher status , you 're required to write a minimum of 50,000 words . The maximum word is generally 60,000-100,000 words . <h> Sci-Fi and Fantasy Books <p> There is no rule on the word limit regarding science and fantasy fiction books . However , most of the books usually fall within the 90,000-120,000 words . The publisher and agents are more lenient on word limits for this genre ; therefore , you 're not likely to lose out on a deal if you exceeded the number of words . You may be wondering why the books in this category are an exception . Well , reading epic novels of this genre are interesting and require the audience to take some time to create the fantasy world around them , and then imagine themselves in it . <h> Adult Novels <p> The generally recommended words usually fall between 80,000 and 100,000 . If your manuscript is over 100,000 words , publishing it could prove to be more expensive . <h> Children Novels <p> The word length for children novels is not set in stone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40,000 words . <h> What is the average word count for an email ? <p> According to a study conducted by Email Labs , people spend about 15-20 seconds reading an email . Sending the readers lengthy email messages may make them feel overwhelmed , and might not read through it . Now , you may be tempted to ask , what 's the right number of words for an email ? Well , it all depends on the ideas or information you want to deliver . A rule of thumb : the shorter message , the better . Always try to limit your email to around 300 words or less . If your email message needs to be longer , it 's absolutely okay . However , focus on the main message , eliminate the distractions , and keep the content easy to scan . <h> How many words should your report have ? <p> There 's no set minimum or maximum , regardless of the type of report . If you 'd like a guesstimate , just assume the audience will take around 10-20 minutes reading the report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page or 250 words in a minute . In 10 minutes they would have read about 2,500-4,500 words . But that 's just an approximation .

When you present a very long resume , you 're simply scaring off the person wholl be reading it . Do n't  forget he/she has other applications to review . Even if you were to be more qualified , there 's a great possibility of wasting your chances . So if you are not instructed to write within a certain word limit , just make sure your application is short as possible , typically less than 500 words . <h> How long should your motivational letters be ? <p> While there are no exceptions , your letter of motivation should n't be longer than one page .

The King James Version of the bible may have more pages than the Revised Standard Version or the New American Standard Version . <p> Because the number of pages in different bibles varies so dramatically , the name of the book in the bible being referenced , the chapter and verse number help us to be " on the same page " when discussing a biblical text . Biblical scholars realized that different versions and translations of the bible could impede research . Page 20 of my King James Version may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This would lead to confusion . <p> By slicing the bible into chunks , research can be more accurate . In fact , you can go to an exact phrase in the bible . Its a system applauded by scholars . <h> On average , how many pages are in the bible ? <p> If you took a run of the mill , everyday bible , and you managed to count all the pages , you would have the following : <p> The Old Testament has 929 chapters . It has 23,214 verses which comprise roughly 622,700 words . The New Testament consists of 260 chapters , divided into 7,959 verses or roughly 184,600 words . This would give our typical bible 1,189 chapters . These are made up of 31,173 verses and using a rough word count , this amounts to 807,370 words , although the King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> Using a standard font , the average bible has around 1,200 pages . As a book , the bible is as thick as " The Lord of the Rings " and similar fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and philosophy , and can be used for spiritual guidance . And that , I believe , is the best answer you will ever get to this question . <p> This is what I hate about Christians . Telling you you 'll end up in eternal torment if you do n't  believe exactly what they believe . How sick in the head do you have to be to tell others that , especially children . if you want to believe , fine , go ahead . But stop trying to scare others into believing . <p> Why are those who are so into the bible always wanting others to go to hell ? It a book . Nothing more and nothing less . You are n't  going to go to hell if you do n't  read it any more than you are n't  going to turn into a wizard if you do n't  read Harry Potter . <p> Its important to make sure you read the right bible . The only right bible is the King James version . Any other bible is n't a true bible and it will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important if you want to go to heaven ! ! ! <p> Who chose you to decide which bible is correct and which is not . If you are going to take this stance , should n't you be reading it in its original language and not English which is a translation ? The translation , including the King James version , is not the true words of god because it is a translation . <p> This is the problem with religion . Everyone thinks their interpretation is correct and everyone elses is wrong . There is a correct Bible ? That means there are Bibles that are wrong . If a Bible does n't  have the right number of pages , its wrong ? That 's just ridiculous . <p> Does anyone know how many pages are in the shortest bible and how many pages are in the longest bible ?

Others cant because they are n't  Christian even if they want to be Christian . That makes a whole lot of sense ! ! ! ! <p> This will depend on so many factors like the language of the bible . A bible written in English will be different than a Bible written in another language . The size of your bible will also influence this . Also there are different versions of the bible so this will all affect the number of pages . <p> If others need to know and that people feel they are the expert on the Bible . You have no more insight into what it means than any other person . Telling people that they cant properly read the Bible because they are not Christian does n't  make any sense at all .

There are legitimate reasons people would want to know the number of pages n the bible although you may not understand that in your state of mind . If all bibles were the exact right number , they would all have the same number of pages . They do n't  . <p> I do n't  understand why Christians cant see by the simple fact that bibles have different numbers of pages and words that they cant all be the word of god . Its obvious that humans have influenced what is written in these books or they would all be the same number of words and the same number of pages . For anyone who thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it apparent that the bible is n't the word of god , but the words of people . <p> Some Christians do n't  take the Bible to be the exact word of God . The words are left for interpretation to better the person who is reading them . You 're taking an extreme example that does n't  apply to the vast majority of Christians . <p> I cant believe that anyone would care how many pages there are in the Bible . It seems obvious that the number of pages would hand on which version of the Bible one was reading and how big the pages were in that particular Bible . There are so many variables that could change the number of pages that its a question that seems ridiculous to even ask . Why would anybody need to know how many pages there were in the Bible ? Its simply a question that does n't  need to be answered . <p> I think a better question would be how many pages of the Bible is it important to read ? A lot of the pages in the Bible are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of the Bible to read to understand the word of God . I believe for your spiritual life this is a much more important question . <p> All the pages of the Bible are important . Each and every word is the word of God . You cant just pick and choose when its God speaking to you , The answer to your question is every single page of the Bible is important . <p> If you ca n't pick and choose , the Bible is a terribly sadistic book . People like to gloss over this , but if you read the pages literally , God is not a nice person . That 's why Christians have to be somewhat hypocritical . Anyone who took every page of the Bible at face value and as literal would not be a nice person . <p> I think Bible is the most important book in the world . If you want to know your real year of born , then the Bible has 66 books subtract your age from it and then add 50 to it and you will get your real year of born 
@@12747133 @1347133/ <h> Do Footnotes Count in Word Count ? <p> When you are writing an essay for a class which has a minimum of maximum word count limit , the question of whether or not footnotes and endnotes should be counted toward this limit can come up . Those who have an essay that is under word count are hoping that their footnotes and endnotes can be counted while those who are over the limit want to make sure that these do n't  count . Which one is it ? <h> Footnotes <p> Do footnotes count when doing a word count ? No , footnotes do n't  count in the word count in most cases . When a teacher or professor gives an assignment with a minimum or maximum limit , its usually done with the intent of being applicable to the topic being assigned . Footnotes are auxiliary information that further clarifies certain points being made in the essay . Since this is n't a part of the body of the essay , most teachers and professors do not count footnotes as part of the essays word count . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exceptions depending on the teacher giving the assignment , so the best policy is to ask the person assigning the essay whether or not footnotes should or should n't be included . If this is not possible , its best to assume that they are not counted . <p> Do footnotes count in a page count ? Yes , footnotes generally count toward page count . Footnotes are found at the bottom of the page and do n't  take up much of the page space in most instances . While its relatively easy to exclude footnotes from a word count , its much more difficult to exclude them from a page count . For this reason , most professors allow them to be included as part of the overall page count . <p> Again , counting footnotes as part of the page count is a general rule of thumb , not a definitive answer . Its always best to ask the person assigning the essay to confirm that this is OK . If you find yourself in a position where this is n't possible , in most cases it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a word count in most cases . Much like footnotes , endnotes give further information to a point made in an essay but are n't  part of the body of the essay . For this reason , endnotes are generally not included in an essays word count . The best policy is to ask directly if you are n't  sure about this , but when in doubt , its better not to count them . <p> Do endnotes count in a page count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a page count most of the time . There is one significant difference between footnotes and endnotes which is endnotes are found at the end of the essay and not at the bottom of each page . Being at the end , its much easier to exclude them from a page count than it is to exclude footnotes . For this reason , endnotes are n't  usually counted when doing an assignment with a specific page count . <h> 16 comments <p> This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word count ? I 'm writing those words . They did n't  just appear out of thin air . If I had to write them as part of the essay , then I feel they should count in my word count . Teachers are always trying to get us to do more work than they originally say . I 'm sick of it ! <p> Quit whining and write the amount you know you 're supposed to write . The only reason a person would consider counting footnotes as part of the wordcount of an essay is that they are n't  able to do the assignment on its on merits . You 're making this into a big ordeal because you just do n't  want to write what the assignment calls for and you 're looking for a way out of it . <p> Although footnotes do have words written within them , they unfortunately do not count at all because they are n't  part of the actual essay writing . This may seem bad but it is how it works unless specified otherwise . If they counted , all everyone would do is footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually have a professor who requires us to count our footnotes as part of the papers word count . This drives me absolutely crazy . I do n't  mind putting in footnotes in most of the papers I write but I hate to do it for this professor . I never have enough room to write everything I want anyway and when footnotes are counted as part of the word count it just means that I have less space to write the points that I want to get across . <p> I 've never heard of the teacher who allows you to count footnotes or the bibliography in as part of the word count . That 's just ridiculous . The word count should be for the essay , not the parts that support the essay . Why would anybody think that they could include footnotes as part of their essay ? <p> What if the teacher does n't  give any guidance when it comes to including footnotes in the word count ? Can I just assume I can count them ? I need them to make my word count . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , do you think she will mark down my essay if I say I did n't  know because she never said anything about it ? I just want this essay to be over ! <p> No . If you are n't  given any guidance as to whether or not you can use footnotes as part of your word count , you should assume that they are NOT counted . That 's the rule in most cases , so you should opt with what is most prevalent . The only time you should count footnotes as part of word count is it the teacher specifically says that its okay to do so . <p> I think that word counts suck anyway . So many times in school I had to go back and add filler words that just made my paper sound dumbed down . It was so much easier to write a good , precise paper , but teachers only seem to care about the quantity instead of quality . Ugh . <p> Or you need to look at the writing from different perspectives rather than from a single one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its usually because they see the question to be answered as one-dimensional instead of from a variety of different perspectives from my experience . <p> I think this will depend on the teacher that gives the assignment because in some cases footnotes actually do count and in others they do n't but if it is not specified chances are they probably will not count . <p> Isnt that what the articles just said ? If your professor says footnotes and endnotes count , then you should count them . If she says they do n't  , then you should n't . If she does n't  say anything , then assume they do n't  count and ask to clarify if you have the opportunity . <p> Neither adds anything to the topic you 're writing about ( just give information about where you got a certain statement of idea ) , so it does n't  add to the essay in a informational way . Therefore , they should not be counted . <p> It would seem counterproductive to have footnotes and endnotes counted as part of the word count . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  actually want in the body of the article or essay . If you wanted them to be a part of it , youd add a paragraph or two to place that information in directly . <p> This is the best answer here . Counting footnotes is actually counterproductive when given an assignment with a min or max . They are n't  a part of the actually assignment . They are an added addition in case you did n't  know something or needed more clarification .

For example , if your essay is about the reasons the US entered the First World War , you might begin with a few sentences outlining the pivotal role the USs entry in the war had and why it was so important . You might begin by explaining why the US was not eager to enter the war to begin with , and then you 'll end your opening paragraph with your thesis statement . <h> Be Sure Your Thesis Answers the Question <p> A thesis statement should be a concise sentence that shows how you 'll answer the question you have been given . As a result , your statement has to be a strong one rather than a vague one . For example : <p> " The United States entered the first world war for several reasons , some of which matched those of its allies , while others did n't  , " is a weak thesis .

Test it by reading your question again followed by your thesis . <h> A Strong Thesis Statement Clarifies the Facts or Your Views <p> Sometimes , you 'll be asked to present facts , and at others , you may be asked to give a personal opinion . Either way , you absolutely must understand the subject matter before formulating your thesis . Once you know what you 're talking about , you can create a thesis statement that 's free of vagueness or ambiguity . <p> " The United States entered the First World War because of German provocation and for internal security reasons , " is somewhat better than our first example , but its still a little weak . <p> " The United States entered the First World War because of German attacks on US shipping and to halt Germanys rapid expansion and growing military power which presented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clear and unambiguous statement . <p> The former reason is the primary deciding factor , but American politicians also feared Germanys expansionist policies . The Zimmerman telegram , an intercepted message from Germany offering support for Mexico if it went to war against the US , confirmed that being on a different continent did n't  make the US safe from German ambition . As you can see , our thesis sums these two primary contributing factors up quite neatly , and the rest of the essay can explore these two points in greater detail . <p> Your thesis statement should fulfill the following requirements : <p> Tell your readers how you have interpreted the subject matter <p> Sums up what will be discussed in the paper <p> Gives a direct answer to the question you have been asked <p> In most cases you would make a claim that is up for debate . For example , some may argue that the USs intervention in the First World War was primarily for moral reasons . My thesis suggests that pragmatic reasons were the deciding factor , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thesis consists of one sentence , usually at the end of the introductory paragraph . <p> You may not be directly asked to formulate a thesis statement , but in general , you can take it as being an element that is expected . <h> Your Thesis Statement Will Undergo Several Drafts <p> As you analyze the information you have at your disposal , you may decide to change or expand on your thesis statement . That 's fine . Your first , second , or even third attempts may not be as comprehensive as you first thought . As one of the most important sentences in your paper , your thesis statement is worth reworking to make it as strong as you possibly can . <p> When in doubt , remember that your teachers are there to help . If they feel that answering your question would be unfair to other students , they will say so . It never hurts to ask if they feel your statement is strong enough . <p> I 've always been told a thesis statement is the statement of what your paper or essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but anyone who reads it should understand exactly what the writing is going to be about .

The fact is , they 're quite capable of missing passive voice , and they 're quite capable of missing real grammatical errors , or identifying correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its important to actually learn your grammar . <h> What 's Passive Voice ? <p> Passive reverses the position of the subject ( the doer ) and the object ( the thing that is acted on ) . Confused ? An example makes it clearer . <p> " The paper was passed by the professor . " That 's passive voice . <p> " The professor passed the paper . " That 's active voice . <p> In the second sentence , you have a normal structure of a subject ( professor ) doing something active ( passing ) to an object ( paper ) . The first sentence makes the paper into the subject and does not emphasize the verb or who committed the act . <p> How do we know which is which ? In passive voice , the doer comes after the thing that was done . Also , you can look for forms of " to be " followed by a past participle . In our example , " was " is a form of " to be " and the past participle is " passed .

" I know how it feels to be confused , " is also active voice because the subject " I " comes before the thing that happened . Further , " confused " is an adjective that describes a feeling or state . <h> Is There an Easy Way to Identify Passive Voice ? <p> Yes , and its really simple .

" That 's active voice . The doer comes first . <h> Why Do People Believe Passive Voice Is Bad ? <p> Although the passive voice is perfectly correct and sometimes even preferable , it may be a trifle vague especially when doers are omitted . So looking at our World War 2 example , Poland was invaded . Who did it ? The second passive voice example gives all the facts , but the third example is the most lucid and concise .

@@12747145 @1347145/ <h> Tag : figure of speech <p> If English is your second language , idioms may well puzzle you . The words that are used have little or nothing to do with the topic under discussion , but English speakers slip them in without thinking twice ( if you 're interested in learning the meaning of many common idioms , you can use this random phrase generator ) . If you are a native English speaker and you 're wondering how on earth these figures of speech came to be a part of the English language , in many instances you 'll have your work cut out tracking their origins . Sometimes they 're well known , and sometimes , they 're quite obscure . <p> You may have noticed I used the phrase have your work cut out . Its a typical example of an idiom . For those looking for a definition , an idiom is a frequently used saying where the words of the saying do n't  relate to their literal meaning . To illustrate , what has cutting out got to do with having a difficult task to perform ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are a lot of stories about how this phrase slipped into common parlance , but nobody is absolutely sure . <h> Mad hatters , cats and dogs and more <p> Although idioms are a bit crazy after all , the individual words do n't  make literal sense , they do make the language more fun and colorful . For example , you could say that its raining very hard , but that is n't nearly as colorful as saying its raining cats and dogs , even though canines and felines are not falling from the sky . The origins of this particular idiom are also foggy , but that does n't  stop us from using the phrase . <p> English is an eccentric language , and its students might even think were all as mad as hatters . Lovers of literature may be pardoned for thinking that the idiomatic phrase " mad as a hatter " comes from the classic childrens story " Alice in Wonderland " , but theyll have to look for darker origins to get to the truth of the matter .

A constant noise , someone elses irritating habit or trying to grasp a difficult concept are all things that might drive you up the wall . No-one really knows when this idiom slipped into English , but the words themselves create the image of someone desperately trying to get away . <p> " Once in a blue moon " , " Over the moon " and " Asking for the moon " are among the many moon related expressions we use . A happy person who has just had something wonderful happen to them is " Over the moon " with this turn of events . A demanding person who wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon " and something that happens very rarely occurs " Once in a blue moon " . So-called blue moons occur when there are two full moons in one month . Its a rare occurrence , hence its use as an idiom . <p> " A case of the pot calling the kettle black " is a very old idiom and was first recorded by Cervantes in his classic book " Don Quixote " . It is used to describe someone who accuses another person of being something that they are themselves . Of course , back then , all cooking was done over the fire , so you can be sure that both pots and kettles were equally black . <p> " Beat around the bush " means avoiding the main point or issue . Its one of the oldest idioms in English , and the oldest example we know of that comes from a medieval poem . Hunters would send beaters out to beat at bushes so that birds or game would emerge , and then the hunt would be on .

" <p> " Bad books " and " Black Books " are idioms for being displeased with someone . On the other side of the coin , there are " Good books " . This idiom demonstrates how the English language has changed . The word " books " was used in the same way as we use the word " esteem " today . There was n't actually a book about how you felt about others , so back in the Middle Ages , these sayings werent even idioms they were a literal form of speech . " Passing the buck " , a disapproving way of saying that someone is handing on responsibilities to others , has its origins in the Wild West .

" Crying over spilt milk " would be a good example of this . Sometimes they come from stories and literature , and sometimes they have their origins in the obsolete uses of words . Studying them is more interesting than you might expect , so getting an idiom dictionary can be a worthwhile investment , even if you already know the meanings of many of them .

" Grad , " of course , is short for " graduate , " and it sounds vaguely similar to the " grat " part of the word " congratulations . " Saying or writing " congradulations " is , therefore , an attempt at a mild joke . <p> I 'm not sure if anyone finds this particular play on words " punny " ( funny ) any more . Even though I am told that I have an unhealthy love of puns , it fails to elicit so much as a smirk .

@@12747149 @1347149/ <h> What is an Average Typing Speed ? <p> For those who are just beginning to type , they are often interested in the answer to the question , " what is an average typing speed ? " The average typing speed is 36 words per minute . Typing speed is usually measured in words per minute , but as most people have noticed , words have different lengths . Depending on your profession , you may need to type longer words than in other professions . For example , if you 're a legal typist , you 're probably typing longer words than most people do . For this reason , the best way to measure typing speed is in characters per minute . The average typing speed , in this case , is about 187 characters per minute . <h> What 's a good typing speed ? <p> A good typing speed for most people is 40 words per minute or over . This would give you a word count of 2400 words per hour if you could sustain the pace for sixty minutes . There are people who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're a professional typist , you can probably type 75 words per minute , and maybe even more . What 's the world record ?

In other words , she can type much faster than most people can talk . <h> How can I improve my typing speed ? <p> Have a good keyboard : Improving your typing speed takes practice and good equipment . If you have to hammer certain keys a few times before they registered , its obviously going to take you longer to type than if you have equipment which performs well . If you spend a good portion of your day on the computer , its worth investing in a good keyboard . <p> Learn how to touch type : Touch typing means that you do n't  have to look at your keyboard when you 're typing words .

Simply do a search for " free online touch typing " and you should have plenty of resources from which to choose/ <p> Posture is important : You may find that you need to alter the height of your chair to get into a correct typing posture . Experts say that you should be able to sit up straight and that your elbows should be bent at a 90-degree angle . Your wrists can rest lightly on the table , but do n't  put weight on them .

So the more you practice your touch typing , the faster you 'll get . Spend half an hour to an hour on practice every day , and you 'll be amazed at how quickly your typing speed can improve ! <p> Take your time : Its worth taking your time to learn accuracy rather than rushing to complete as many words per minute as possible before returning to correct them . Corrections take up time , so getting things right the first time around will help you to improve your overall speed . You 'll still have to check your work , but if you follow the rules of touch typing and keep your eyes on the screen , there should n't be much to correct . <p> Improving your typing speed will make you more productive and will help you to capture your thoughts before the inspiration disappears . <h> 11 comments <p> I do n't  think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the fastest in my class .

For example , when I write about gender discrimination in the workplace , I always remember to point out that women can also be guilty of this . <p> A female boss I worked under years ago did n't  like hiring young women , " Theyre just going to get married and move away or have babies , and then we have to give them maternity leave , " she would say . This illustrates that women are sometimes also guilty of gender discrimination . <p> You can also use anecdotes to amuse or entertain . Not all anecdotes are serious ! If something really funny happens to you today , you 'll tell your friends , wo n't you ? That 's an anecdote ! here 's one of my favorites : <p> My brother used to have an absolute obsession with answering the phone in time .

He called out in a panicky voice , " Ring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get answered . I was laughing much too hard for that ! <h> How to Write an Anecdote <p> First , be sure the anecdote you have in mind is relevant to the context . If you are writing about dogs , for example , an anecdote about a cat is irrelevant . Ask yourself , " Why do I want to use this anecdote ? What point does it illustrate ? " <p> Next , consider these questions : <p> Who was involved in the story ? <p> What happened ? <p> When did it happen ? Is this relevant ? <p> Where did it happen ? Is this relevant ? <p> Because an anecdote is a mini-story , you structure it in the same way that you would structure a longer piece . You introduce the story , you say what happened , and you either draw a conclusion or ask a question so your reader can reach his or her own conclusion . <p> The main point you 're trying to get across is your " punchline " ( whether its funny or serious ) , so save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person or group of people directly involved in the story . In my anecdote about a sexist female boss , I introduce her , but not the other people on the recruitment panel . They are not relevant to the story itself , so we leave them out . <p> We also do n't  bother to mention the weather , the color of the boardroom furniture , and so on . These facts do n't  contribute to the story . If they did , we could add them . Always remember you 're illustrating a point , and anything that does n't  form part of that point will be a distraction . <p> Once you have introduced your players and have provided any necessary context to set the stage , you can move on to explaining what happened . Begin at the beginning and write the events chronologically . Its possible to tell your anecdote differently , but this is the easiest way to keep it coherent and easy to understand . Lastly , state your conclusion , or ask your readers to draw their own conclusion . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At most , they will consist of a paragraph , or maybe two paragraphs . Stories are longer . When we write stories , we can include a lot more detail , and we will spend more effort on drawing the reader into the scene so that they feel part of it . <h> Can an Anecdote Be a Single Sentence ? Yes , It Can <p> " My cat always cuddles me in the morning . " <p> " George is so polite , he always shakes hands instead of just greeting me . " <p> " When I was a student , I worked in a bookshop after classes . " <p> Admittedly , these are n't  great anecdotes , but they are anecdotes nonetheless . <h> How to Write a Great Anecdote <p> Choose a relevant event that happened to you or someone else ( even a famous figure ) . <p> Is your story interesting , amusing , inspiring or thought-provoking ? Try to aim for at least one of these . <p> Can an anecdote also be a story ? I 've heard the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an anecdote can be a story , but you say there is a difference in one is short and one is long . 
@@12747151 @1347151/ <h> Should You Use a Pseudonym When Writing ? <p> A lot of famous writers have published their work using pseudonyms or pen names , and the reasons they give for doing so are many . Back in the days when women werent considered bright enough to be serious thinkers and writers , many female authors wrote under male pseudonyms so their work would be taken more seriously . Fortunately , those days are gone , but there are still many reasons to use a pseudonym . <h> You 're Writing on a Controversial Topic <p> Some topics are extremely decisive and can cause a lot of anger from those with an opposing viewpoint . You may not want to start receiving the hate mail that comes with advocating certain views , so you may decide to generate a pen-name . For example , if you were to write in favor of atheism or are pro-choice , you might think it wise to keep your own name out of the equation to avoid being ostracized by friends or family members who do n't  share your views . There are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudonym , but I can understand the reason why some people would make this choice . <h> You Write in a Variety of Genres <p> People often buy books by authors they like because they think they know what to expect from them . As a result , authors sometimes use pseudonyms when they depart from a genre in which they are well-known . J.K. Rowling , famous for the Harry Potter series , wrote a detective story under the name Robert Galbraith for this reason . Its definitely not a childrens book , so she obviously felt she should use a different name so people would n't buy her book with expectations based on her earlier work . <h> You Have the Same Name as a Famous Author <p> If your name is Stephen King , it would n't really be fair to raise expectations by publishing your work using your own name . Besides , you want to become famous as an author in your own right , so you may choose another name to distinguish yourself from another author . <h> You Do n't  Like Your Name <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kids with weird first names . Admittedly , if your work is good enough , you should be able to overcome this handicap , but if you think your name is so strange that people wont take your work seriously , you might consider choosing another . <h> Your Name Is Too Long or Hard to Pronounce <p> You would n't want your name to occupy the entire book cover , so you follow the example of Dennis Max Cornelius Woodruffe-Peacock and choose an abbreviated form of your name . In this example , the author went of the much simpler " Max Peacock . " The same thing is true if your last name has less than the standard amount of vowels and you do n't  want to hear it being mangled by readers who ca n't properly pronounce it . <h> You Have a Common Name <p> If your name happens to be John Smith or Mary Jones , you might decide you 'd like something a trifle more distinctive . Once again , your writing will be the deciding factor behind your success or failure , but its understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit more exciting . <h> You Want to Separate Your Day Job From Your Writing <p> Writers are often secretive about what they 're up to , and not all employers will be enchanted if someone in a very serious line of work were to produce a racy novel . It does n't  suit their corporate image , and you may find yourself in an awkward position in your day job as a result of your writing activities . Other employers may simply feel your heart is n't in your job because your " real " interest is writing . It is n't really fair , but it does happen . <h> You Have Higher Writing Ambitions <p> Some publishing houses produce endless streams of formula-fiction , and of course , they need writers to make the stories varied enough to keep their readership interested . Romance series are a good example . There 's no formula that actually says what has to happen on each page , but the stories tend to be similar . Readers know what to expect .

If you 're still hoping to write a serious novel , you might want to hide your pulp fiction persona behind a pseudonym . <h> Your Publishers Will Know Your Real Name <p> Whatever your reason for choosing to write using a pseudonym , you have to remember anonymity can only go so far . You need to cover the legal side of things , signing contracts and protecting copyrights ; and of course , you do want to be paid . You will have to give your real name , but you can add " writing as " in front of your pseudonym to indicate your public persona will be represented by a different name . <h> 2 comments <p> I think people who use a pseudonym are weak . You should be proud of your writing and put your name behind it . Its only those people who are afraid that hide behind a pen name .

@@12747152 @1347152/ <h> How to Increase Your Essay Word Count <p> When you have an essay assignment with a minimum word count , one of the worst feelings is when you believe you have finished only to find that you 're still well below the minimum you have to reach ( as opposed to having too many words ) . Many students try to solve this problem by rewriting the essays sentences to make them wordier or splitting contractions . While these do increase word count , they usually make the essay weaker in the process . It does n't  have to be that way . If you ever find yourself in a position where you need to increase the number of words for an essay , below are some simple techniques which can help you add to your writing while improving it instead of writing unneeded filler . <h> Add Examples <p> Skim through your essay looking for any place you have used an example to make a point . In most cases , you should be able to provide additional examples which will make your essay stronger by showing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also go through the essay and look for statements made where inserting an example would be appropriate to help support the statement . <h> Address Different Viewpoints <p> An effective way of increasing word count and improving your essay at the same time is to address different viewpoints to your own . You have the opportunity to discuss how these alternative viewpoints differ from the conclusions you have made , and it gives you an opportunity to explain why you believe your conclusions are superior . This shows you have considered a range of different opinions while coming to your conclusions , and in doing so make your essay stronger while adding more words . <h> Clarify Statements <p> When you find the statements in your writing , if inserting an example does n't  make sense , then clarifying the statement may be appropriate . This can be achieved by inserting one or more specific statements to clarify the original one . A common way to do this is to follow the statement with , " In other words " Its important not to over-clarify statements or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to look like filler , but using it sporadically throughout your essay can increase the word count and show you perfectly understand the points you 're trying to make . <h> Find Additional Sources <p> Another way to improve your essay and increase word count is to find additional sources you have n't previously mentioned which support the statements and conclusions you have made . The more sources you have , the stronger the essay will be in most cases . Spending some time searching for additional sources to add to the essay can be a great way to add quality content to it . <h> Use Quotations <p> Chances are you already have appropriate quotations in your essay , and if that 's the case , skip over this suggestion . Adding more will likely not add to your essay . If you have n't used any , however , finding appropriate quotations from experts in the field that support your statements can be an excellent way to add words to your essay while improving it at the same time . <h> Rework Introduction and Conclusion <p> If all of the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need some filler , look to put it in your introduction and conclusion rather than the body of the essay . Most teachers give more leeway with the introduction and conclusion to be wordy than the guts of the essay . This is something you should try to avoid if at all possible ( its never good to be wordier than you have to be ) , but if you tried everything else , its better to do it in these two places than in the heart of the essay . <h> Page Count <p> If you 're writing an essay which has a minimum page count instead of a minimum word count , the above suggestions will work , but you have a bit more wiggle room as well . You can make slight adjustments to the font and font size you use through a Words per Page Counter . As long as you do n't  go overboard , this can be a relatively easy way to increase page count while not taking away from the essay . <h> 61 comments <p> I hate it when teachers give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be the quality of the writing . If I can get my point across in 1000 words , why do I need to write 2500 ? It makes no sense at all . <p> That 's a lazy answer . Students who write well should n't be punished with a word count because other students are n't  good students . Its the teachers job to help those students who are n't  doing as well without forcing those good students to do stupid things that make no sense for them . <p> If you can make it more fun to read , this can also help with word count . Add emphasizes or explain something in more detail . There are so many great ways to increase your word count . It should n't be too hard if you put your mind to it ! <p> Word count never mattered as soon as I got to college , my professors used the " bikini rule , " short enough to keep it interesting , long enough to cover the important parts . Do n't  use 2000 words to say what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its easy to increase word count on an essay , but its difficult to increase word count to make the essay better . So many people decide to increase their word count by inserting sentences , paragraphs , quotes and other non-necessary information simply to reach the word count . While it achieves the goal of increasing the word count , it does n't  make the essay any better , and it usually makes it much worse . What you should always strive for is to increase the number of words in the essay while also making the essay stronger than it was before . <p> In my experience , college is even worse than high school in this regard . I regularly have to conform to word counts and page counts . Right now , I 'm writing a research paper that has an 8 page minimum . Why ? Because the professor said so .

I think making minimum word counts is one of those . On the other hand , I think that maximum word counts can actually be beneficial because it forces the students to better edit their writing . <p> " Teachers too often tried to make things easier on themselves to the detriment of the students they are trying to teach . " Are you making this very bold statement because you have experienced it as a teacher , completed an in-depth research on this topic , or are you just making your opinion seem like a fact ? I ask simply because I am a teacher , a high school English teacher to be more specific , and I found your comment to be nothing but overblown opinion . I can not speak for every teacher , but in my class , I have to put a minimum word count on my essay assignments or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a paragraph and say it is an essay . It would not matter that I instructed them on the purpose of the essay , explained what an introductory paragraph , body paragraph , and a conclusion paragraph are and their individual purposes . It also would not matter if I also spent an entire six week grading period teaching , instructing , modeling , and practicing writing essay , I would still have some that would turn in a ridiculously short essay and argue that they have " gotten to the point . " However , any logical person would know that these students essays would not meet the required components of an essay and would not serve as evidence of mastery , which is what a teacher is suppose to do right ? Help students master certain skills , regardless of what is " easier on " them ? <p> Just write approx 500 words per day ; spend like 1-2 hours for the next couple day adding like 500 words every time . Or you could be a knucklehead like me and try to get it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning because you fell asleep at 3:30 <p> Yes ! This is what I need . I do n't  understand how people can write under the word count given . I 'm ALWAYS over , and by a lot . I had a 1000 word paper to write and I wrote 2500 . Teachers never give enough word count for writing . <p> A thesaurus is your friend when you are only a bit under word count . I 'm glad to see you added one to your tool . its so much easier than going back and forth to another thesaurus website . Thank you for making this useful tool and not charging any money for it . <p> Adjectives and adverbs can help with this , but it wo n't make the essay stronger . You usually want to eliminate adverbs and adjectives in your writing to make it better . You have to make a decision as to whether word count is more important or a better essay is more important before using these methods . <p> As a teacher , I 'm glad to see legitimate ways for students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks " students do n't  think we know , but we do . Adding random words in white so it appears the word count is higher than it is does n't  work because we know approximately how many pages the assignment should be . Best to actually do the work ! <p> You are the exception . I have a great way to increase word count when I 'm short on words . I will write a bunch of random text at the end of the essay , then change it to white so you cant see it even though its there . Now the teacher thinks you have written the required word count . Brilliant ! Teachers are so clueless that this works 100% of the time . Now you will never be under your word count and you do n't  have to write a bunch of filler crap that is n't needed . You can thank me later . <p> There must be so many students who come to this article for the exact same reason as I did . ( " hi " all you sleep-deprived people ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how to make it longer before tomorrows class . thank you for this list of ideas . I think I 'll be able to incorporate a few of them to make my essay long enough to reach the word count . <p> I think attitude has a lot to do with it . If you 're writing an essay you have little to no interest in writing , its much more difficult to write it and reach the word count . If its something you have a lot of interest in , then the issue is usually staying beneath the word count limit . One of the best ways to increase word count on essays is to take an interest in the topic . If you learn to become more curious and have an interest in things that may not at first seem to be interesting , you 'll be surprised at how much easier it is to write essays and to always reach the designated word count . <p> That easy to say and all , what if your teacher assigns you a topic ? And what if that topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are boring and you have no interest in , so of course its going to be difficult to reach the word count . If you 're in school , you have to write with the teacher tells you to write , not what interests you . So your suggestion sounds good and all , but in reality we do n't  have that choice . <p> I think the best way to increase the word count of an essay is to add more examples . This clarifies what you 're trying to say which adds value to the essay so anyone reading will understand exactly the point you want to get across . All my friends are bad at giving examples , but I am good and I 'm always going over the word count while they are always under . <p> It maybe the easiest way to increase your word count , but if your entire essay is all quotes you probably are n't  going to get a very good grade on it . Quotes should be used to support the points that you 're trying to make , but they should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school , you have to know the difference between these two . <p> This is lazy writing . It will not help you become better in the long run , and the teacher will see what you 've done and mark down your paper . The easiest way is often not the best way to approach increasing an essay word count . <p> This is really a skill that every teacher should teach their students . Not just assign an essay , but explain how the steps they need to take to reach a word count . It would be a great benefit to most students ( I know some students are wordy and always hit their word count , but most of us do n't  ) . I wish teachers cared enough to actually help us . <p> On almost any topic you care to mention volumes have been written . To imagine you have covered the topic fully and still be 500-600 words short of required count is ridiculous . The idea that the shortfall is due to the clarity of your arguments or exceptional command of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its too short , it lacks content . Do more research . <p> The quality of your writing may suggest you are the love child of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen , but if it does n't  cover the assignment material you wo n't get the marks . <p> Teachers know the key points they expect to be covered on an assignment and allow a word allocation for each point , as well as marks allocation . <p> For example , a 1,000 word requirement may indicate a short intro and conclusion and 4 x 200 word key points . <p> You might be able to work out the scheme by reviewing assignments where you scored well . How many key points did you make , compared to word count ? <p> Not everyone is born with the ability to write or enjoys writing , so sometimes it can be extremely hard to write a long essay . These tips surely did help a lot . I would also suggest learning enjoy writing more . If you like to do it , it should be easier to do . <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum and maximum word count assigned ? Is it for the students benefit or the teachers ? I 'm curious as it would seem that word count shouldnt really matter , but that actual writing for the assignment . I waiting to hear a good answer to this question . <p> Word count forces students to be more concise in their writing and focus on the most important points . Minimum word counts make the student research more to find alternative supporting evidence they may have overlooked without it . <p> If you cant increase your word count , you do n't  know what you 're writing about well enough . There should be no issue writing about any topic up to 5000 words as long as you are familiar with the topic . If you find you do n't  have enough to write about something , its because you have n't taken the time to study the topic well enough . <p> This is n't true . Sometimes you do n't  need a lot of words to cover the topic at hand and adding more words just to increase word count does nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words , but they are useless and do n't  make the essay better . Why would anyone want to do that ? <p> Any teachers out there ? Why exactly do assignments have a minimum and maximum word count assigned ? Is it for the students ' benefit or the teachers ? I 'm curious as it would seem that word count should n't really matter , but that actual writing for the assignment <p> As teachers , we know approximately how long an essay should be to get the points across for that particular assignment . That is why we assign a word count . If the student is well under they have not explored the topic in-depth enough and if they are well over , they are being too wordy .

" I cant sincerely offer " best " regards to absolutely everyone . Surely some people have to get second-best regards , so I settle for " Regards " and hope for the best . <p> There are forms of the " Regards " sign-off that irritate me , but not everyone else , so presumably its acceptable . " Warmest Regards " or " Warm Regards " strikes me as slightly patronizing and insincere , especially when it comes from someone who ca n't possibly have any feelings , warm or otherwise , about me .

Apparently , " Cheers " is becoming quite popular , and some use " Warmly , " " Best " or " Very Best . " I will be unashamedly biased here . None of these is particularly appropriate .

@@12747156 @1347156/ <h> What is a Pronoun ? The 10 Types <p> If you want to become a better writer there are a number of steps you can take like improving your vocabulary . It also helps to have a good grasp of grammar , and what may initially seem to be simple is n't always so . For example , can you guess how many pronouns are in the following sentence ? <p> " I bought all of these myself , so these are mine ; they are my things ! " <p> If you were able to find seven pronouns , then you found them all . If you found less than seven , you can check the answer by looking at the words below in bold . <p> I bought all of these myself , so these are mine ; they are my things ! <p> Yes , each word in bold is a pronoun . Remember , a pronouns relates to a noun , and that 's why the word " noun " is inside " pronoun . " When you do n't  want to or cant use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pronouns <p> Since English is a complex language , there are different classes of pronouns . The most important ones are personal pronouns . " I " is the most common example of this . Then there are " we , you , he/she , it , they . " They refer to humans , or living beings such as animals , so they are personal . I the simplest terms , they deal with persons . <p> " Myself " can be either an intensive pronoun or a reflexive pronoun . In the sentence above , its intensive because the speaker wants to emphasize that he alone bought the items . And since " myself " actually refers to " I , " not a proper noun , you can see that pronouns sometimes refer to other pronouns . In the sentence below , " myself " is reflexive : <p> " I gave myself a good lecture because I was disappointed in my work . " <p> The person doing the action and the one receiving the action are the same , so its a reflexive act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " self " or " selves " must be either reflexive or intensive , depending on how they are used . <p> Reciprocal pronouns involve actions or feelings that happen between two people . For example : <p> They gave each other Christmas presents . <p> They like one another so much that they are never apart . <p> The two most common ones are , naturally , " each other " and " one another . " <p> Possessive pronouns are easy to understand . They show who owns or who has something . " My , your , his , her , its , our , their " are possessive . Would you say : " This is Mandy , David , Sue and Lisas house ? " No . You would say , " This is their house . " In this way , possessive pronouns are useful and convenient . Absolute possessive pronouns are similar : " mine , yours , his , hers , ours , theirs . " The difference between the two types is that you can not use a possessive alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The telescope is my property . 2 . The telescope is mine . <p> In the first example , a noun must go with " my . " The second sentence shows that " mine " does n't  need one . <p> You use a relative pronoun when you want to introduce more information or another idea . <p> " The park , which is far from the city , has a zoo with African animals . " <p> When you ask a question , the first word is often an interrogative pronoun . <p> Which horse runs the fastest ? <p> How do you wash the dishes so well ? <p> As you can see , " which " is either relative or interrogative . How you use a pronoun can determine what type it is . <p> Another issue that makes pronouns a little more complicated is a word like " how . " It does n't  refer to any noun . It is used to ask about a way or method or cause . <p> When you read or hear " this , that , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouns . They show people exactly what is being talked about . <p> " This table is worth thousands , but that one in the corner is worthless . " <p> Finally , we have indefinite pronouns . They are n't  like the other types because they do n't  refer to any specific person or object . " All , some , any , none , no one " are examples of this . When you use these pronouns , you are speaking or writing in a general way . These words can refer to many possible people <p> All the people of the world want peace . <p> Some of them love to laugh , but others are very serious . <p> As you can see , answering the question , " What is a pronoun ?

@@12747157 @1347157/ <h> Specially vs Especially : What Is the Difference ? <p> That 's right , this specially compiled article is especially for those who struggle with the difference between the words " specially " and " especially . " But how did this confusion arise to begin with ? I suspect the trouble started when people began to use " specially " as an abbreviated form of " especially . " Although some sources say the two words are interchangeable , the really reputable ones say they mean two completely different things and are only interchangeable in certain contexts . <h> What do these words have in common ? <p> Both of them are adverbs ( words that are used to describe a verb ) . Both of them can mean a thing was done for a particular purpose . For example , " I got this ( e ) specially for you ! " <p> In this context , those who say either word means the same thing are spot on . However , I would venture to say " specially " would be the more common form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cambridge Dictionary defines " especially " as meaning " particularly or " above all . " Let 's watch it in action : <p> " She adores flowers , especially roses . " <p> " He hates work , especially hard physical labor . " <p> If you were to replace " especially " with " specially " here , you would have sentences that people can understand , but your word choice would be considered colloquial at best . <p> Now let 's try the same exercise with " specially . " This word refers to a specific purpose for which something was done , and yes , its just like our very first example , where we demonstrated that " especially " and " specially " are interchangeable in certain contexts . Now you can play fast and loose and switch these two words around as you please . But remember , when the word you are looking for means " particularly " or " above all " ONLY " especially " will do . <p> " The furniture was ( e ) specially designed for my living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ) specially for her . " <h> Knowing which to use <p> Think of the word " particularly . " If you can replace the " special/especial " with " particularly , " then only " especially " is absolutely correct . Let 's look at one of our earlier examples : <p> " She loves flowers , especially roses . " <p> " She loves flowers , particularly roses . " <p> Does it work ? Yes , it does ! So " especially " is the right choice , while " specially " would be incorrect . <p> You 'll notice that trying to jam " particularly " into a " for a special purpose " meaning does n't  sit quite as comfortably . <p> " He bought the reddest rose particularly for her . " <p> Does it work ? Not particularly ! Now we know we can use whichever of the two words we prefer . Do n't  you love freedom ? If you 're in doubt , stick with " especially " since it works in both contexts . You cant go wrong ! <h> How important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not especially . " <p> Which of these is right : the first one , or the second one ? If you guessed that the second version is correct , you really do know the difference between these two words already . Congratulations ! <h> Can you be sure ? <p> " Not particularly , " works well in this context , so you can be sure that you are 100% correct . <p> But returning to our question " How important is it ? " what do you think the answer is ? I 'd say that if you 're using language simply to be understood , it is n't especially important because people would probably understand you even if you used " specially " in the wrong place . However , in written English , we have to be especially ( particularly ) careful about word choices , and picking the wrong one would make your teacher , or an especially ( particularly ) well-informed reader , upset at the wording .

Let 's put it this way , there are a lot of things that are simple , but are n't  in the least bit easy , and there are other differences too . Let 's start with that first one . You want to write a book . Its simple , is n't it ? All you need to do is sit down in front of the computer and type . But is that easy ? <p> The day you decide to begin writing , your kids decide to invite all their friends over resulting in a houseful of chaos . The six hours of quiet time you planned for writing never materializes . On the second day , you set aside the time but also come down with a case of writers block .

@@12747159 @1347159/ <h> What Are Proverbs ? <p> Proverbs are commonly used expressions that illustrate a specific point . They differ from idioms because idioms do n't  always make literal sense , but if you have a context , you can usually work out what a proverb means . Here are a few examples of idioms : <p> I passed the exam by the skin of my teeth . <p> I 'm fed up with waiting for him ! <p> He always rubs me up the wrong way . <p> If we were to look at these literally , they 're just nonsensical . Since they are often used , however , most people will know what they mean even though they do n't  have any skin on their teeth , havent been fed lately , and did n't  get a massage from a clumsy person . <p> Proverbs , on the other hand , do make a weird sort of sense , especially when you have the context of the situation . <p> My mom was always against beatings , but my father would say : " Spare the rod and spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself , but there 's no use crying over spilled milk . <p> Do n't  just invest in that business because it sounds nice . Check out their financials ; you need to look before you leap . <p> I searched and searched through my overstuffed closet , but finding my best tie was like trying to find a needle in a haystack . <p> After he was rude to me , I wanted to hit him , but two wrongs do n't  make a right . <p> In our first example , the fictional father is taking words straight out of the book of Proverbs in the bible . You can see that the discussion is about beatings or corporeal punishment . You might use a rod to beat someone , and if a child is spoiled through lack of discipline , he or she will always insist on getting their own way . Whether you agree with beating naughty kids or not , you can see what the proverb means . <p> Our other examples are non-biblical , but they are so old , and so well used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crying over spilled milk " means regretting something that has already happened and ca n't be undone . " Looking before you leap " means getting all the facts before you commit yourself . And although the guy who ca n't find his best tie is n't literally " looking for a needle in a haystack , " we can see that he thinks the task is as difficult . The last little bit of wisdom , " two wrongs do n't  make a right , " is really easy to understand . If I were to hit someone because they were rude to me , I might have a reason for my action , but it still would n't be right . <p> You can get whole dictionaries full of proverbs , but some are more commonly used than others . Here are a few examples with their meanings : <p> I was n't sure how to behave in the high-class gathering , so I thought : " When in Rome , do as the Romans do , " and just followed their example . <p> This proverb means behaving as everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When in Rome " because its so commonly used . <p> I was going to argue with the shop manager after he treated me so badly , but the pen is mightier than the sword , so I wrote a bad review on Yelp instead . <p> Written arguments are often stronger than spoken ones , or even using violence . <p> You really ought to ask for help from others . After all , no man is an island . <p> An island is all alone , surrounded by water , but people are surrounded by other people , and we can influence or help each other . <p> How can you call others lazy when you are so lazy yourself ?

The question becomes , when is the best time to set aside writing time each day ? While many will say to set the time aside when you enjoy writing most , Ive come to the conclusion that 's not necessarily the best approach when you are trying to increase your writing productivity . <p> As I mentioned earlier , I take a walk each morning which is an important aspect enabling me to be a productive writer . Upon my return each morning , I sit down to do a minimum of an hour , and as much as 3 hours of writing . The actual amount of time I have each day to write depends on what other things I have to do , but I make sure I have that minimum of an hour to write each morning . Since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head during the morning walk , I usually can hit my 1000 words during that hour . <p> I think its important to set aside time in the morning to write even if you do n't  happen to be a morning writer . I feel I can make this claim because I 'm definitely not naturally a morning writer . I used to do all my writing late at night , and I still do a good amount of my writing during the evening hours . What I 've discovered over time , however , is if I only set aside time in the evening to write , I fail to reach my writing goal much more often than if I set aside time in the morning . <p> There is a simple reason its important to put aside time in the morning if you want to be successful writing a certain number of words on an ongoing basis . Life happens . There will always be unexpected events which will make it impossible for you to write during your designated time no matter how faithfully you plan . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't yet established it as a routine . It takes time to carve out a specific period of time each day that 's devoted solely to writing , and one should expect hiccups while in the process of establishing this time ( and even afterward , although not as often ) . <p> When something happens and I 'm not able to write during my planned time in the morning , I immediately realize I missed the time I was supposed to writing . I instantly begin to figure out when I can make up that time and squeeze in writing so I can still reach my 1000 word goal . I have the rest of the day to make up for the unforeseen event and still reach my goal . <p> When I was writing in the evenings , if something unexpected happened , it was much more difficult to make up for life impeding on my writing . There just is n't enough extra time in the day to reschedule for missed time when its already in the evening , and the day is almost over . Due to the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you a much better chance to reach your word count goal when you take up a challenge . <p> Another huge factor that came into play for me is energy level . The amount of energy I have at the end of the day depends on a lot of factors which happen during the day that are n't  always in my control . The result was that even when I had the time set aside , I was more likely to be tired . Many times I did n't  have the energy to concentrate on my writing the way I should so even when I was writing , the quality was n't necessarily the best . <p> If you 're not a person who usually writes in the morning , this change will be difficult . I know because of how difficult it was for me to adjust . Even today , I do n't  feel as comfortable writing in the morning as I do at night , but Ive gotten a lot better at it over time . More importantly , I have seen how much more productive I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than toward the end . <p> For anyone who has the goal of writing 1000 ( or more ) words a day , its worthwhile taking the time to figure out how to set aside time in the morning . That does n't  mean you cant write in the evenings as well . I still do on a regular basis , and as I 've stated above , I actually enjoy writing in the evening more than I do in the morning . Creating morning writing time will greatly increase your chances of hitting your word count goal each day .

People write " your " when they mean " you 're , " they write " affect " when they mean " effect , " and they often mix up " its " and " its . " Unfortunately , these words are n't  interchangeable and have very different meanings . <h> Incorrect Tenses <p> Whatever you do , be careful how you switch tenses . Although there are times when you can do so , you need to follow the right formula . " I was putting on my makeup when the perfume bottle falls over , " is an example of incorrectly mixed tenses . <h> Comma Usage <p> It would be easy to write an entire blog post on when commas should and should n't be used .

If you do n't  , you could end up with a hodge-podge of ideas that do n't  make sense to your reader . What is the thought you 're trying to get across ? Introduce it . What points will you discuss in order to reinforce your central idea ? Organize them into paragraphs . What do you think this proves ? Bring it all together to a conclusion . <h> Singular Noun with Plural Pronoun ( or the other way around ) <p> This can be trickier than it sounds . For example : " When the student council got together , they decided to approach the dean with their problem . " It sounds fine , does n't  it ? What a pity its wrong . The student council is a single body or entity , therefore , it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its not a person . Substitute " it " and " its " for " they " and " them " and alls well . <h> Too Complicated <p> Sometimes bosses like this sort of thing . Theyre impressed when you write " With regard to " instead of " Regarding " or " About . " They like " We are of the opinion " rather than " We think " and so on . Admittedly , none of these examples is actually wrong and does help you increase your word count , but using language like this can sound pompous and makes the message less clear . I have been at loggerheads with many employers about clumsy , formal phrases . Business communication should be clear . <p> The other danger that lurks in wait for those hoping to sound impressive is long-winded sentences are much easier to get wrong . Writing simply and clearly makes your work easier for you to check , and reduces your opportunities for error . <p> here 's a lovely example of " correct " but long-winded writing : <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protuberance , the purpose of their expedition being the procurement of a sample of fluid hydride of oxygen in a large vessel , the exact size of which was unspecified . One member of the team precipitately descended , sustaining severe fractional damage to the upper cranial portion of the anatomical structure . Subsequently , the second member of the team performed a self-rotation translation oriented in the direction taken by the first team member . <p> What does this mean ? here 's the answer : <p> " Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water . Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after . " <h> Grocers Apostrophes <p> Youve seen the signs outside stores : " Apples , bananas and carrots special ! " Restaurants are also often guilty : " The best pizzas in town ! " Those apples may be on special , and maybe the pizzas are pretty good , but the apostrophe use is n't . Apostrophes signify a missing letter in an abbreviated word like " do n't  , " and they can indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The apostrophized version , in this case , is an abbreviation for " it is " . <p> And my favorite is a mistake I sometimes see when someone is signing off a letter and write " Kind retards . " To avoid these errors , read through your work carefully , preferably aloud . Spell check is helpful , but only up to a point ( or pint ) . <h> 6 comments <p> Most of the writing mistakes I see as a teacher are ones that the students know , they just do n't  proofread to catch them . If students would learn to proofread , most of their grades would significantly increase . Its just laziness , but its so difficult to correct since it has to be the students who want to do it . <p> I 'm also a teacher . Its easy to tell who has and has n't  proofread their papers . Really easy mistakes to correct if the students read through the paper once time , but did n't  . It tells me they really did n't  care about the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing mistake , its usually due to laziness .

@@12747163 @1347163/ <h> The Difference Between Wether , Weather , and Whether <p> You look at the page and see three words : weather , whether and wether . Although none of these three words is spelled the same , they all sound the same when you say them . They 're classed as homonyms . They have the same pronunciation but different meanings . Its easy to confuse them , and its easy to write one word when you really want to use another ( this is more common than you think in English such as with on to and onto , and it can happen even with words that are n't  homonyms like further and farther . How can you tell the difference ? <h> Wether : something you never knew about sheep <p> First , " wether " is hardly ever used , so you can almost forget about it , but its still good to know its meaning . Yes , some people might write it by accident instead of " whether " or even " weather " but it means something completely different than both those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat that 's had a particularly sensitive operation in the groin area we wont explain in detail here . Its only farmers and animal experts who usually need to know and use this word . <h> Weather : just look out the window <p> People everywhere love to complain about the weather no matter if its the rain , the wind , the sun , or a combination of all of these . Weather is the state of the natural environment in a place at a particular time . Cold weather comes with winter , and hot or warm weather arrives in summer . <p> Of course , the northern hemisphere has winter at the same time that the south has summer . This means that different seasons actually occur at the same time in different places , not just different weather . This is where weather becomes a little confusing , but you do n't  need to worry about this . Just understand what the word means . When it starts with " we , " its talking about the natural conditions that " we " experience . <h> Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , " whether " has absolutely nothing to do with sheep or how it is outside . This word is normally used as a conjunction . " And " is a conjunction . So is " or . " Consider this sentence : <p> " Whether we go to the moon or not , we will think its beautiful . " <p> Its almost the same as saying : <p> " If we go to the moon , or if we stay on Earth , we will think the moon is beautiful . " <p> So " whether " is very much like " if . " And you can see that you have two choices . One is fabulous : you can visit the moon . This means you 're either an astronaut or a billionaire with your own private space vehicle . If that 's so , you can stop reading this right now and do all the important things you have on your schedule today . The second choice is a lot duller : to stay home . However , both choices allow you to appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A variation of this occurs in the following sentence : <p> " I do n't  know whether I can pass astronaut training school . " <p> There is just one situation stated here : to pass . You can either pass or fail , so you have two choices , but the " pass " option is the only one stated . In the first sentence , you can either go or not go , and that 's two choices as well , but both are clearly stated . <p> And if you want to pass astronaut school , we recommend a lot more advanced math and science in addition to English . You also need to be athletic , healthy , smart , dedicated , lucky But anythings possible . <h> Language keeps changing whether you like it or not <p> " Whether " also used to be a pronoun that meant the same as " which " or " whichever . " For example : <p> " Whichever you buy , the Rolls-Royce or the Cadillac , you 'll have a great car " can also be stated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have a great car . " <p> Now , these are not personal pronouns like " I " or " you . " There are quite a few types of pronouns , but they all have this in common : they replace nouns or refer to nouns . So in the sentence above , " whichever " refers to " Cadillac " and " Rolls-Royce . " Since " whether " is not really used as a pronoun these days , you do n't  need to remember this definition . Just think " if " any time you see " whether , " and you 'll be on the right track . <h> Whatever the weather you 'll know whether you 're right <p> Knowing what the weather will do next is n't easy , but knowing whether you should use one homonym or another is just a little memory game . As for the sheep , most people would n't know what you were talking about anyway , so just call them sheep and you 'll be doing just fine .

@@12747166 @1347166/ <h> Tag : writing challenge <p> You have decided you want to write a book in the next year . That 's great , but now you need to come up with a plan to make that happen that 's simple enough to help you reach the goal , yet allows you to write enough to complete a book within a year . One easy and effective way to accomplish the book-in-a-year goal is to take the 365-day book writing challenge . <p> The concept of this challenge is simple enough that any writer , no matter what their level , should be able to follow it to reach their goal . Most people who decide they want to write a book fail because they try to do too much in too little amount of time . This challenge leverages the fact there are 365 days in a year and that you want to build a daily writing habit . <p> The book writing challenge works in the following way . Once you decide to begin , each day you need to write between one and 365 words . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to cross the highest number off the chart , but as long as you write any number of words which corresponds with a number that 's still available on the chart , you 're golden . At the end of the day , you place an " x " on the chart over the number of words you wrote that day . Each day you do this for the entire year and at the end , you will have written 66,795 words . Even more importantly , you 'll have established a daily writing habit which you can then use to write your next book in even less time . <h> 365 Day Book Writing Challenge ( click on image to print PDF ) <p> To be successful in this challenge , there are a few important steps you should take . First , you should print out the challenge sheet . Once done , you should put it somewhere where you 'll see it daily . Tape it to the top of your laptop computer or hang it on the bulletin board above your writing desk . The chart needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , even if its only a little bit . This visual reminder will help you reach your daily goal of writing and the ultimate goal of finishing your book . <p> The second rule is you are n't  allowed to go to bed until you have crossed off one of the numbers on the sheet . There really is no excuse not to cross off one of the numbers . The truth is that if you are unable to cross off a number each day of the year with all of the smaller word counts available , you 're not serious about writing the book . In a way , its a test to determine if you are willing to take the actions necessary to write the book , or if you just say you want to , but its only words . That may sound a bit harsh , but if you cant write a few words each day- no matter what happens in life , writing the book is n't a priority in your life . The only thing that can keep you from completing this challenge is yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of success is that it takes into account the reality of life . There are going to be busy days and days when the unexpected happens and you wont be able to write as much as you hoped . You should always shoot for the highest word count number still available on the sheet , but when a day comes when that is n't possible , crossing off a smaller number is perfectly acceptable . <p> While having a book written at the end of the year is a huge deal , the biggest benefit of this challenge is something you 'll gain that 's far more important . This challenge requires you to write every day . Even the days when you 're only able to write a word or two , you must sit down and write something . That daily writing will turn into a daily routine by the end of the year . Once you have established that habit , you have created a foundation which will allow you to write far more the following year . <p> If you have had the goal to write a book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I encourage you to try the 365-day book writing challenge . It has a lot of things going for it that other challenges do n't  , which increases the likelihood you 'll actually complete it and reach your goal . Best of all , at the end of the year , you 'll have a book written and you 'll have the skill-set in place to write as many more as you want to in the future . <p> For all those who are planning to participate in the National Novel Writing Month challenge in November , you may want to try a warm-up word count challenge with me in October . For anyone who is n't , but who wants to increase the amount of writing they 're producing , there 's no better time to begin than at this moment . Over the next month , I will document my 1000 words a day challenge . 1000 words a day is a great goal for any writer who wants to begin getting into the habit of writing on a daily basis . As part of the challenge , I will explain some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who are also doing this challenge ( or who have done a similar challenge in the past ) , will contribute their insights and tips to the conservation as well . <p> As I explained in a previous article , there are a number of steps anyone who decides to take up a challenge like this should consider and answer to better define the challenge . Doing so will make it more likely the challenge is completed . Here are my answers to each step : <p> Step one : How many words will I write each day ? 1000 . <p> Step two : What 's the minimum number of words I must write each day ? 100 . <p> Step three : How long will the challenge be ? One month ( during October ) . <p> Step four : Will there be any off days ? No . <p> Step five : How will I let others know about the challenge to keep myself honest ? I will be doing this by recording it on this blog throughout the month . <p> Step six : How will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge ? I will do it here on this blog . <p> If Im successful with the challenge , I will have written a minimum of 31,000 words by the end of the month . Going by past experience , even if I do n't  reach the goal , I should write more than I would have without the challenge as long as I continue it for the entire 31 days . That 's a vitally important point for all these challenges . While you should do your best to achieve the goal , the true benefit from these type of challenges is to get you writing on a daily basis , and to write more than you would have if you had n't  undertaken the challenge in the first place . <p> So I put forth this challenge to all those reading this now . Commit to begin a 1000 word a day challenge for a month and see what you can produce . If you have any questions along the way , feel free to ask them in the comments of any challenge article . While I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I write this month , I also want to try and help any writer who is having problems writing consistently over a period of time . <p> Below are a list of articles Ive put together as part fo this challenge on tips and hints you may be able to incorporate into your own writing habits to increase your productivity : <p> If you find yourself in a position where you are n't  writing as much as you would like to , a great way to push yourself to do more is to do a 1000-words-a-day challenge . The actual number of words you choose to try to write daily does n't  have to be 1000 . It can be any number that fits your writing goal , and it can be higher or lower depending on your circumstances . 1000 words a day is a good starting numner if you are n't  sure how much you have been writing . <p> If you have taken one of these challenges in the past , you may not have managed to complete it . What often happens is a writer sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents them from achieving the number of words they set . They then try to make up for the words they failed to write the previous day in addition to their normal daily goal . The result is many get behind to the point where they do n't  feel they can make up for the past days and quit . This is a complete shame because , in many cases , they were still writing more than they were before the challenge , just not their predetermined goal . <p> There is a simple solution to this which will greatly increase your chances of completing the challenge without quitting in the middle . In addition to your daily goal , you want to set an absolute minimum number of words you will write each day . A good number for this is 10% of you daily word goal . For example , if you want to write 1000 words a day , the absolute minimum you will write in a day would be 100 words . While this may seem like a silly little thing , it can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge . <p> The biggest change is that it redefines failure . Instead of failing by not writing 1000 words , you only fail if you do n't  write 100 words . If you cant write 100 words one day during the challenge , then one of two issues is going on . You either are n't  truly committed to writing 1000 words a day , or 1000 words a day is too ambitious a goal for you . <p> The 100-word minimum is a failsafe . Again , if you are barely making 100 words each day , then your original goal of 1000 was unrealistic . This minimum should only come into play when something unexpected happens to prevent you from writing , not because of writers block . What it allows you to do is to be disappointed you did n't  reach 1000 words one day without thinking you failed the overall challenge . It also means you do n't  have to make up the words the next day . It keeps the challenge going instead of giving you an excuse to quit . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Having that daily minimum number means that no matter how hectic a day may get , you have made writing a big enough priority that somehow , someway , you 'll find 10 minutes to sit down to write those 100 words . It also prevents you from beginning to form the bad habit of having days where you do n't  write at all , and reinforce the habit that no matter what , you will write at least a little bit each and every day . This will help to reinforce the fact that writing is a priority in your life , and something you are determined to do on a daily basis . <p> Below are the steps you need to take to set up your challenge : <p> Step one : Determine the goal of how many words you want to write each day . <p> Step two : Determine the minimum number of words you must write each day ( 10% of your goal amount is a good number ) . <p> Step three : Determine the length of the challenge . It could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever best fits your circumstances . If you are trying this for the first time , a month is a good place to begin . <p> Step four : Determine if there are any off days . Some people may not have any at all while some may exclude weekends or one particular day each week . Again , make the challenge fit best to your particular circumstances . <p> Step five : Let others know about the challenge to keep yourself honest . When you let others know you are attempting a challenge , even if its only your family , you usually make a more concerted commitment , and hold yourself more accountable , than if you do n't  tell anyone else . its harder to quit when you 've stated to others what you 're going to do . <p> Step six : Keep track of your daily word count throughout the challenge , and record it somewhere . If you 're truly committed to reaching your daily word count goal , you 'll find the challenge will greatly increase the amount you 're able to write on a daily basis , and over the length of the entire challenge .

This allows others to know how you 're doing in real time toward your writing goals . <p> There are a couple of ways you might want to use this . For example , if you write blog articles and you have a daily goal of writing 1000 words a day , you can begin writing each day and people will be able to see where you 're at during the course of the day ( and whether you meet your goal ) . Then you can begin from zero the next morning and continue to repeat day after day . <p> If you have a longer piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Stating your writing goals and placing them out there so all can see is a great way to keep yourself honest , and it can be a great motivator to write on a daily basis . If you truly want to get a good amount of writing done daily ( or over a longer period of time ) using one of these trackers is an excellent way to do so . <p> I usually have a minimum writing goal of 500 words a day , although I sometimes increase it for certain periods when I need to be extra productive .

You ca n't be overly modest and put yourself down , but you also ca n't brag like crazy , or you 'll end up looking egotistical . Youll be asked a lot of questions about yourself . Which words should you use ? <p> Recruiters do like to see a touch of modesty . There 's something about a know-it-all that sets anyones teeth on edge . The company will also want to know how you 'll fit in with bosses and colleagues . Theyll be looking for qualitative information that is n't to be found in your resume . Here are some statements that recruiters love : <p> " I am eager to learn . " <p> " I am determined . " <p> " I never give up until I get something right . " <p> " I get on well with all kinds of people . " <p> " I like to keep a positive attitude . " <p> " Hard work does n't  bother me . I actually like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I like everything I do to be well-organized . " <p> Of course , if any of these statements do n't  apply , you should n't use them . If you get the job , people will soon see you werent being truthful . The above statements apply to any job and they indicate you 'll be a cheerful , hardworking employee . But there are a few extras you can mention in specific types of jobs . <h> Best Words for Customer-Service , Sales or Marketing Interviews <p> Let 's be frank , not everyone is suited for customer service . No matter what company is interviewing you , they will want to know you 'll be good for their image . That means looking neat , but not overdressed , having good posture , being pleasant , and being well-spoken . Try these lines to describe yourself if questions arise where you can utilize them . <p> " I can keep my cool under pressure . " <p> " I do n't  easily lose my temper . " <p> " I 'm good at multi-tasking . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love making peoples day . " <p> " I believe customers are the most important part of any business . " <p> " If necessary , I can be assertive without being rude . " <p> Do you get where this is going ? Recruiters want to know you can handle having two people waiting for you while the phone is ringing , and another customer is being unreasonable and rude , while still being unruffled . <p> They also want to know you 're an organizer . Can you keep track of several tasks for specific customers in a disciplined way ? For example , a sales rep may get a call , have to get information , call back , record the order , get the order dispatched , correctly invoiced , and call the customer again to follow up . They must do this for several customers at once , so things can get pretty chaotic unless they 're smart organizers . <p> In marketing , they also want to know you 're people-oriented and organized , but theyll want to know more about the creative aspects too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Accounting or Administrative Interviews <p> Apart from the things we looked at in the generic statements , there are some extra statements recruiters like . <p> " I 'm a perfectionist . " <p> " Organizing data so that it makes sense is rewarding for me . " <p> " I 'm a methodical person . " <p> " I like working systematically . " <p> As you can see , you 're demonstrating a different set of qualities . You like getting things done in a calm and organized way . You crunch away at your work according to a specific system , and you like being part of that system because it results in useful , condensed information of some sort . <h> Best Words for Management Interviews <p> I 'm going to be brutally honest here .

How you dress for your interview matters a lot . Play safe and stick to understated , yet smart clothing . Ladies , not too much makeup or perfume please ; my apologies if this offends you , but this is the real world . <h> Be true to Yourself <p> If you do n't  feel you can honestly say any of these things , do n't  . You must be able to back your statements up with evidence from your life . " I 'm very determined . For example , I. " <p> You should also ask yourself whether you 'll be happy in a job where you have to pretend to be someone other than who you really are and whether you 'll even be able to do it . You probably wo n't . What do you get ? Short service and a bad reputation are the two things no future employer is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at instead . <p> Its worth taking the time to get comfortable describing yourself with these words before you go in for an interview .

A business proposal must look and feel attractive . The golden rule to remember is " first impressions count . " <p> Its a great pity that many otherwise fantastic business proposals fall flat . A common theme apparent in the vast majority of rejections is based on the golden rule . The authors of these failed proposals did not make first impressions count , at least not in their favor . And one of the questions that probably was never asked that may have helped was , " What is the best font for a business proposal ?

It would imply that this is a business environment . Do not expect to find unicorns dancing on any rainbows here . J S Shark and associates . Attorneys at law . <p> It should be evident that the font used in a proposal will be very different from that used in nursery school signage . The subliminal message should be clear ; this proposal is serious . It means a lot , has been well-researched and contains information of value . It was not banged together using a sloppy approach . It should speak for itself . It needs to say , " I am important . Read me in my entirety . Pay attention to my content .

An example here is the Coca Cola font with its famous curling ribbon . <p> Fonts such as these may have patents or legal clauses ( similar to logos ) which prevent their commercial use by unauthorized 3rd parties . Some fonts are all in upper case , - and others in italics only . All of these can be classed into two separate categories . Serif and sans-serif . <p> Serif fonts , such as Times New Roman , have small " feet " at the bottom of certain letters .

On the rare occasion when I require a large heading which will stand out above the others , then Arial Black is the way to go . <p> Fonts which are sans-serif do not have the " frilly bits . " They include examples such as Arial Black and Verdana , neither of which has letters with feet or curly bits .

@@12747172 @1347172/ <h> Tag : point of view <p> There is an art to persuasive writing and many people seem to struggle to master it . While it comes naturally to some , for others a little practice may be required . The important thing to remember is that anyone can actually write persuasively , provided they follow a few basic guidelines . <p> A persuasive essay is written to convince the reader to accept a point of view . You may want them to sympathize with your cause or to take a particular course of action . Persuasive essays are often used in advertising and politics . Business proposals , applications for study grants , fundraising , debates etc. are all examples when persuasive writing may be beneficial . People who are good at this style of writing are in high demand . <p> If you are trying to convince someone to side with you , you 'll want to be thoroughly prepared . It does n't  help if you have a list of excellent points but fail to pay attention to the weak arguments . By following the following simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong case on which to build upon . <h> Planning and Preparation <p> Before you even begin writing a persuasive essay , its crucial that you take the time to do the preparation . Every aspect of your essay needs to be considered . Begin with deciding on your stance . Think about why you have chosen this position . What are the motivating factors ? Do you have facts to support your case ? <p> Another important consideration is understanding your audience . Who are they ? Do they have strong opinions , or are they undecided ? What are they looking for and what appeals to them ? The more you can appeal to their needs and interests , the more persuasive you will be . <p> Finally , you need to research , research and do more research . You need to come across as a person who knows what he or she is talking about . If you have your facts wrong , it will weaken , if not destroy , your argument before you even begin . Do n't  rely on just one source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater your chances of shooting down any opposition . <h> Style and Structure <p> Any persuasive essay should follow a logical progression . The best way to do this is to begin with an introduction . Your introduction needs to immediately grab the readers attention . You should provide a brief overview of your argument and state why your case is worthy of merit . <p> The main body of your persuasive essay will detail the evidence in support of your case . Each section should deal with one piece of information , presented separately . Its important to provide evidence in support of all your facts . <p> Before closing , you should highlight the major points of any counter argument . Again , its essential that you provide evidence that refutes opposition to your stance . You can make use of quotes from experts , can include real life examples or refer to relevant facts and statistics . <p> Your conclusion needs to be a short synopsis of what has already been stated . Your closing sentence should be dramatic . It should leave the audience wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose . Provide solutions to problems and encourage the reader not to delay . <h> Revision <p> One aspect of writing a persuasive essay which is often omitted is the importance of revision . There are a few questions you should ask when revision your essay . Does the essay impart enough information ? You should n't expect your audience to know everything , so the more information you can provide them with will allow them to make an informed decision . Do your points contain compelling evidence in support of your argument ? Making wild , unsubstantiated claims will set you up for failure . Each point of merit needs to be justified . Does the essay follow a logical path ? Are words carefully chosen for maximum impact or is the essay difficult to read with little meaningful information ? Does the essay present the strongest possible argument or does it require more facts ? <h> Editing <p> Once you have finalized your persuasive essay , you need to make sure it is free from any typos , spelling mistakes or grammatical errors . Ask a friend or relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view . Remember , you 're not trying to convince yourself . You 're trying to convince others who may not have the same insights as you . <h> Presentation <p> Once everything is complete you 'll be faced with the task of presenting your essay . Make sure a good , easily readable font is used . Each section should be clearly identifiable with relevant headings . If you 're familiar and well versed with the content of your presentation , there 's no reason why you shouldnt be able to successfully persuade those who read your essay .

On the other side of the argument , some are pushing for even greater standardization .

Sure , you can see that clothing , artwork , or artifact in an online catalog , but getting up close to it will reveal the tiny details you cant see in a picture . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a sense of what the people who lived there experienced as far as weather and scents . They are also great places to get writing ideas . <h> Personal interviews <p> Never underestimate the power of actually talking to someone who knows what you want to know . Whether you 're interviewing a CEO for an article about life behind the desk , or a zookeeper about his work ( since your novels main character is also a zookeeper ) , there is no substitute for the experience of actual human beings . You 'll not only hear about what their life is like , you may also get to watch them in action . <h> Archives <p> There are archives at almost every level of government . Some schools , churches , and businesses also keep archives . You may be able to find old yearbooks , original editions of books and manuscripts , letters , photographs , and many other documents of historical importance . Many of these things are not made available online due to their size or the fact that they ca n't be put into a scanner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities are a treasure trove of information . Their libraries often subscribe to journals and newspapers that municipal libraries do n't  carry and which may not have an online presence ( or , if they do , you as an individual will have to pay to subscribe ) . You can talk to professors that teach and research the topic you 're working with . If your work is fiction and set at a college , you can spend a few days observing the students and their activities . Some larger universities also have collections of artifacts or documents related to local history , art , and culture . <h> In-person visits <p> Sure , you can Google the location for your next novel and see pictures and maps , but there 's nothing like being there . When you actually visit a place , you can experience the people , traffic patterns , weather , and architecture in a way that pictures and maps cant convey . You can hear the sounds and smell the smells , as well . All those details will lend an authenticity to your work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location is too far away , try setting your book closer to home or at least let a native of the area read your work to see if it feels authentic to them . <h> Support groups <p> If your character is an addict , an abused spouse , going through a divorce or dealing with grief , it can be hard to put yourself in those types of situations . If you 're writing non-fiction about these tough topics , you 'll need more of a personal experience than books can give you . Support groups , though , are full of people dealing with those types of situations . You may be able to sit in on some group meetings if you ask in advance and mention that you are doing research for a book . You 'll likely be asked to keep in the background and to keep anything you learn confidential , but hearing the stories and seeing the emotions can give you what you need to make your work authentic . <h> Reenactments <p> Reenactments are n't  limited to just the battlefields , although those are invaluable if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and other " living history " museums reenact everything from the nightly lamp lighting in a village to butter churning . Seeing how a process actually worked is better than reading about it and then trying to recreate it on the page . <h> Observation <p> This is simple . Get out and watch what people do . If your character is a teenager , spend some time watching what they do and how they act with each other . If your character is a teacher , ask if you can shadow a class for a day . Is your character a farmer ? Tag along with a farmer for a day . Find ways to observe the people you want to write about . Itll make for a more authentic work and it may take your character beyond the stereotype that you would have otherwise created . <h> Businesses , organizations , and associations <p> There are all kinds of organizations that might have the information you need . Whether you 're looking for information on how a product is made or how a rescue organization does its work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various organizations and asking for information or observing how things work . Unless the information is proprietary or confidential , many organizations are wiling to share . <h> Hobby groups <p> If you need to know what its like to be someone who flies model airplanes , scuba dives , restores old cars , or plays Dungeons and Dragons every weekend , you might want to visit some local hobby groups . Many do n't  require membership and are happy to show off their hobbies to others . You do n't  have to learn how to do the activity yourself , but watching other people do it and asking questions can yield a deeper understanding than simply reading about the hobby online . <h> Veterans groups <p> Want to know what a certain battle was like , or what the uniforms of the time felt like ? There are no better people to talk to than those who were there . While you can only speak directly to veterans of more recent wars , you can find groups dedicated to preserving the memories and information gleaned from those who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences of women on the home front . <h> Courthouses <p> Courthouses have records of births , deaths , real estate transactions , and business filings . Not to mention all of the criminal files . Much of this information is public record . They also house some historic documents and records that are open to the public . If your character is a lawyer ( or criminal ) you can even spend some time in the courtroom watching actual cases unfold as many trials are open to the public . <p> The Internet can be a good place to begin your research or gather general facts , but when it comes to the small details and personal experiences that make a work authentic , there 's no substitute for getting out into the world and observing how actual people live their lives . And who knows ? Maybe in the process of researching one work you meet someone or hear a story that is just so fascinating that it becomes the idea for your next work . <h> 1 comment <p> Excellent article . In any profession where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration for what you are writing . What works great on the internet are useful articles that visitors questions , help then solve a challenge , or help them with something actionable they can do . As referenced above , sometimes it takes going out of the office , and getting into the head of your target audience , whether it be at a coffee shop , or hobby group , or anywhere else they hang out . Find out what people really need and want , and fill that need . You cant go wrong by doing this . 
@@12747175 @1347175/ <h> Simple Ways to Improve Your Blogging Productivity <p> Blogging , like working out and minding your diet is good for you . But it has one other thing in common with looking after your health it can be hard to get around to . You tell yourself that you 'll post three times a week , and before you know it , the week is over and you have n't written a single paragraph . If you find you do n't  post as often as you 'd like to on your blog , here are some fixes that you can try to write more each day . <h> Write your posts in the morning <p> Whether you think you are a morning person or not , research has shown that mornings are our strongest times for exercising willpower . All the choices we have to make throughout the day wear us out . By the time you get to relax in a quiet space in the evening , you 're more likely to flop down and watch TV than craft a great blog post . Get up earlier in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but struggle to get round to . <h> Turn it into a habit <p> Write every day ( or at least , most days ) at a set time and you 'll build a habit . That means you do n't  even think about whether or not you will write . You just do it . It takes a bit longer than the 21 days that many people believe habit formation takes , but once you have established it , you 'll watch your blogging productivity soar . Even better , it does n't  have to be every single day you can take weekends off if you prefer . <h> Set daily word count goals <p> As part of building the habit of daily writing , its also good to set a daily word count goal . Its important to set a realistic goal that will make it likely that you 'll be able to achieve your daily goal so you continue it throughout the year . You might also want to write that book while you 're creating more blog content as well . <h> Take notes <p> Have you ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful blog post ? Then when you actually get around to sit down to start working on your blog , you no longer remember what that great idea was ? This should never happen . Get into the habit of using your phone or a notebook to record sudden ideas , and expand on them a little so that you can re-discover your inspiration . That way , you wo n't find yourself thinking " What on earth did I mean by that ? " when you consult your little memo . <h> Write first , edit later <p> Do n't  interrupt the flow of your thoughts by pausing after every sentence or paragraph . Get your ideas fully roughed out and then go back to edit . That way , you wo n't lose your inspiration while you wrestle with typos , check your spelling and adjust your fonts . <h> Get some exercise before you begin <p> Exercise makes you alert and improves your concentration it also stimulates creative thinking . Does that sound crazy ? Researchers have found that people performed better in creative thinking tests after going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you adopt this habit many famous artists and writers habitually took a brisk walk before settling down to write . <h> Take breaks <p> A 30 second break can improve your mental clarity by up to 13% , and a two-minute break every half hour or so can work wonders for your productivity . Just looking up from your computer screen every now and then will reduce your fatigue . So if you want to be more productive take short , regular breaks . Stretch . Take a few deep breaths . Return to your writing feeling refreshed and alert . <h> Plan your distractions <p> While you 're researching your post , you may come across some interesting websites . Bookmark them for later rather than checking them out right there and then . Social media and email can also provide hours of distraction . And its not just a matter of sharing the occasional Facebook post or sending a Tweet . By the time you return to your writing , it will take a few minutes before you can get your thoughts back on track . Try the Pomodoro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can then schedule your planned distractions or use them as rewards during your short breaks . <h> Plan before you start <p> Draw a mind-map or rough out your subheadings before you begin writing . Not only will your work be more structured and have a good , logical flow , you 'll save yourself from losing the blog posts focus and having to delete chunks of irrelevant writing that does n't  have much to do with what you 're trying to get across . <h> Research before you write <p> Instead of researching while you 're actually writing , try to do all your online research before you even begin . You can copy-paste relevant paragraphs under your sub-headings so that you do n't  have to look through umpteen open tabs to find the nugget of information you wanted to include in part of your article . This should make the blog writing smoother and help you get the post done in less time . <h> Choose a quiet uncluttered environment <p> Have you ever noticed how easy it is to get a lot of work done in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work wonders . Keep this in mind when choosing your workspace for blogging . You cant possibly be productive with the TV on , kids demanding attention and chores staring you in the face whenever you look up from your work . Some people are better able to tune out noise and distractions than others , but you still wont be at your most productive . Find a distraction-free place to write and make that your writing area each morning . <h> 6 comments <p> I want to write 1000 words a day , but no matter how hard I try , I never seem to be able to get to that number . I always fall short . All my friends seem to be able to write that amount with ease . I 'm the only one who is a failure . What am I doing wrong ? <p> Do n't  try to start writing it all at once . Choose a number that is a bit lower . When you consistently meet that on a daily basis , set the goal a little higher . It takes practice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you set out to do it step by step with small weekly improvements , you should be able to eventually reach your 1000 words a day goal . <p> I think one of the main reasons people fail at blogging is because they simply do n't  write enough to be successful . Writing every day , or at a minimum of several times a week , is not easy . You have to make a concerted effort to be able to produce quality content on a regular basis , and that requires you to be productive as much is possible when you are working on your blog . All of the above may not apply directly to you , but if you can find one or two things that do help you become more productive in your writing and blogging , then you come away in a better position to get more done . That 's what I try to do with every article I read . Try to take a nugget that you can use in your own life to make it easier better . <p> Always do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense or do not grab your attention while reading , so make sure to do your research before posting on a subject . Also make sure to make it fun to read that will attract more people . <p> I appreciate you writing about this topic . There are a lot of times its difficult for me to stay motivated and write as much as I want/need to write . Its a constant struggle and I 'm always looking for new suggestions on how to increase my productivity . Thank you for the tips . I hope to incorporate some of them to be more productive and to stay motivated . <p> I think when it comes to blogging you need to make it a habit and actually post quite frequently . Then again , also not too much . You have to find that happy medium . Choose a set time of day that you can stick to and post daily or even twice a day . 
@@12747176 @1347176/ <h> What Are No Content and Low Content Books ? <p> When people talk about books , there 's usually the assumption that to have a book you need to have written content . This is why most writers focus on daily word count . They know they have to write a certain number of words each day if they hope to complete their book . <p> If you are n't  a good writer , you likely assume its impossible to make money creating and selling books . This assumption is actually not correct . In fact , there 's a thriving business with both " low content " and " no content " books these days . <h> What is a no content book ? <p> A no content book usually refers to a book that has no written content in it . That does n't  mean it only has blank pages ( although it can ) . It simply means there are n't  any words in the book . A couple of examples of no content books would be a blank journal that only has lines for writing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  have written content in it , then it can be considered a no content book even if it contains other forms of content . <h> What is a low content book ? <p> A low content book is one that contains some written content , but far less than one would find in a typical book . A journal that had inspirational quotes on each page would be considered a low content book . A day planner with the days of the week and months listed would be another example . A mileage tracking book for the miles you drive your car each day of the week would be another . Even a recipe book could be considered a low content book . While low content books do have some written content , its a lot less than would be typically found when one imagines a book . <h> Can you make money with no and low content book ? <p> Yes , its possible to make money with no content and low content books .

Large corporations , chain stores , and small groups may often buy these books as well . Many are used as corporate gifts or novelty items . <p> If you are n't  a good enough writer or have the patience to produce a novel , no and low content books may be a perfect alternative for you if you have the goal to publish a book .

There are a lot of programs on the Internet that can help you create them in a matter of minutes . I started doing them when there was a lot less competition and I made quite a bit of money . Its more difficult now because people know you can make money with them , so there are a lot more out there these days . But you can still find niche markets that can do well . I thought no content books were a scam when I first heard about them , but with a little creativity and effort , you can make some good money creating them . <p> This market has been saturated . Anyone trying to get int adult coloring books at this time will fail because everyone has already heard and tried to make money with them . In order to make money with no or low content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a new niche before the hoards descend upon it . Its not easy , but that 's where the money is .

A daily planner is n't a book . Coloring for adults is n't a book . A book is a novel . A book is a mystery . A book is a nonfiction story . A real book has writing . No content is not a real book . Low content is not a real book . If those people think they are writing a book , they are fooling themselves . You have to write to create a real book . <p> This is a pretty pretentious stand to take . Who made you the dictator of what is and is n't a book ?

If you do n't  know what you 're doing , you will waste a lot of money , not make it . Its not easy money . If you think it will be , you 'll be sorely disappointed . <p> It is much more difficult to make money writing low/no content books , but its still possible . You need to find your right niche . General adult coloring books do n't  do well because they are so overcrowded , but niche topic adult coloring books still do . You have to work a bit harder than a few years ago , but you can still make money . I do . <p> I think that the process of , say writing , designing and publishing a commercially viable " Quotation of the Day for Target Audience Inspirational Journal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , its different than writing a novel or a book of nonfiction essays or even a book for infants . But from idea to execution to product to marketing and sales its got to be a daunting undertaking . After researching the vast array of inspirational journals available and doing your research as to which of these are most likely to sell and which of these you have the ability to confidently create a product for , you 're finally down to the task of choosing and targeting a niche audience for your journal . Coming up with a unique angle and theme for your journal , researching your competition , collecting , fact-checking and curating all the quotations you wish to include will be a lot of work , as will obtaining permission to use them within the context of your journal from the necessary sources . Ensuring you have all the appropriate legal attention , attribution , and rights to each of these sources sounds like a nightmare to me .

Did you know there 's paper made from rocks that can get soaking wet without disintegrating or smearing ? What if you do n't  do your consumer research and make a HUGE mistake in packaging that alienates your target market ? It may well be that you think our hunting enthusiasts would obviously find a quality leatherbound journal appealing But turns out that those hunting enthusiasts who enjoy journalling are totally different consumers than those hunting enthusiasts who DO NT enjoy journalling .

I truly dislike it when someone label something that does n't  conform to their view of what it should be as not being that thing . No content books and low content books are still books . They may not be the classic type of book people think of when a person says the word " book " but there books nonetheless . <p> And the truth is a lot of these books take a lot of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to count them as books because they may appear easier to create than writing a novel . I 'm sure that is true in some cases , but certainly not in all cases . <p> I had the opportunity to write so no content books . I was happy with the way they came out . I will continue to create them . I have n't made much money yet , but I think there 's potential to make some good money in the long run . You have to take some chances to make money , and this is a chance I think is worth taking . <p> What type of no content books have you been writing ? If you have n't made much money creating them so far , what makes you think that there 's the potential to make a lot of money with them in the future ?

@@12747177 @1347177/ <h> The Difference Between Alot , A Lot and Allot <p> Since there is such a lot of confusion about homonyms ( words that are pronounced in the same way but spelled differently such as wether , weather and whether ) , its time to allot the task of explaining this trio to you . That last sentence may already have explained the difference between allot and a lot quite economically , but let 's have some fun with our words and also get around to alot . <h> Spoken and Informal English <p> When we speak , we seldom think about the individual words we use as much as we think about the phrases . So when you say " How are you ? you probably chose the whole phrase out of your mental linguistic archives rather than thinking about every word . Its almost as if your brain sees the phrase as a word in itself . <p> When we say phrases like this , we often run the words together so that they almost sound like one word , and that 's where a lot of English errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word ? <p> When we use English to write informally , we sometimes lump words together , even when they do n't  really belong together . Alot is one of these , and under current English rules , its really incorrect . People use it to say a lot , and although some argue that the contraction without the space is n't a big deal and may be accepted as correct English at some time in the future , it is n't correct today . <p> If alot does ever become an accepted form , it will be strictly informal . Other lumped together words that are accepted in informal writing are gon na and wan na , but you definitely wont be using them in a business letter or school assignment . <p> To avoid confusing your friends , a lot is definitely the way to go , and it means exactly the same thing its the opposite of a little bit . So I hope you have learned a lot already , and that you wont be using alot in future . <h> What Does " Allot " Mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to allot the task of explaining this trio to you " So obviously , I am using the word to describe giving a task . I could also say : " Reading my essay on How to Write a College Admissions Essay is your allotted task for today . " Or I might say " I am allotting you the task of , " or " I allot you the task of " <p> So I can use the word " allot " to share out tasks or work . I could also use it to describe something else that well share : " Of the $50 we earned at our lemonade stand , I 'll allot $10 to you for your help " . Its possible Im being a little greedy with my profits and keeping the lions share , but at least I am sharing . " Allot " is a verb , but it can be turned into a noun , by adding " ment " to the end . Now we have a noun describing a thing that is shared , so an " allotment " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of land that has been shared between several people . An easy trick to remembering this is that " allot " indicates some kind of sharing , and sharing requires at least two people " allot " has two ls . <p> " Allot " is quite a formal word , so youd usually use the word " share " when you 're talking to friends about dividing up a pizza or the costs of a fun trip . Its also perfectly correct to use " share " in most formal contexts , so if you 're not quite sure about when it would be appropriate to use " allot " use " share " instead , and you cant really go wrong . <h> Spell Check Pitfalls <p> My computer does n't  like it when I use alot . Every time I type it , auto correct shoves the space in there , and I have to go back and fix it . Once I 've done that , spell check underlines it in red showing me that its a mistake . But if I were to type the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , it would do exactly the same thing . I 'd mean " allot " but get " a lot " , and thered be no indication from spell check that my work contained any mistakes to speak of . That 's just one example that illustrates the need for careful proofreading even when you have spell check to help you . <h> 3 comments <p> Nothing drives me crazier than people who write " alot " I know its irrational to get so upset about something that appears trivial , but so many people do it all the time . Its a huge pet peeve of mine . Does it bother other people as much as it bothers me ? <p> I have to agree with you . Not sure why this bothers me is much as it does , but like you , I 'd go insane whenever I see people write a lot as alot . I was lucky that I had a teacher who made sure we did n't  make this mistake when I was in middle school . That may be why seeing it still bothers me to this day .

For example : <p> Marketing professional with 3 years experience <p> Creative thinker <p> Fully conversant with online marketing techniques <p> Strong interpersonal skills <p> Goal-orientated approach <p> Enthusiastic , passionate and energetic <p> Just be sure that you can back up any of these points with practical examples if anyone were to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility does n't  go amiss . You could highlight your positive personal traits and your willingness to learn , for example . <h> Education <p> List your educational achievements from the most recent to the oldest . Say what qualification you achieved , specify which educational institution you attended , and give the date your qualification was awarded . You should attach copies of your certificates in an appendix . <h> Work experience <p> You need to show recruiters how you have spent your time since you achieved your qualifications . Give your most recent job first , and continue in reverse chronological order . Your employers name and the dates you started and ended the job acts as a header . <p> Recruiters also like to see a contact person and a telephone number here , since it makes it easy for them to verify your experience and get an opinion on how you performed . Provide a summary of what your responsibilities were , starting each one with a verb . <p> You need not give a reason for leaving , but if you 've changed jobs fairly frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if your first post was an internship , and the second a fixed term contract that could help to explain why you changed jobs twice in two years . Recruiters see red flags when looking at a resume that seems to indicate you 're a butterfly . <h> Optional odds and ends <p> If you have any specific achievements that say something about how you would work in an organization , you could list them under Additional Achievements . So if you won a scholarship or held student leadership positions , these could count in your favor . <p> You may also have attended short courses which , while they are n't  actual qualifications , demonstrate your interest in your field . List them under Relevant courses . <p> Other skills that you may have acquired without ever doing a course may be of interest to a recruiter . For example , if you 've mastered important graphics programs and can do graphic design even though you did n't  study in that direction , that may be of interest if you 're applying for a post where your extra skill could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could also list this since it may indicate your areas of interest and show that you 're a responsible person . <h> Hobbies /Interests <p> This is also an optional extra , but recruiters like to see whether your personality makes you a good fit . Saying you watch TV probably is n't very helpful , but mentioning that you enjoy going to karate class will make them see you as a person of action with a certain amount of self-discipline . <h> Contacts / References <p> Even if you listed your reference contacts along with your work or educational history , you should add a handy guide at the end . Its all about making it as easy as possible for a recruiter to verify the information given in your resume . This may sound like its not that important , but it is . Making the recruiters job easier shows that you will be helpful and make the people you work with lives easier as well , even if its only subconsciously . Its little things like these that often stand out the most . <h> Do n't  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't  forget to include any reference letters and certifications . Again , this makes it easy for the recruiter to verify your information . Now you 're ready to get that resume out there and knock em dead !

But it has one other thing in common with looking after your health it can be hard to get around to . You tell yourself that you 'll post three times a week , and before you know it , the week is over and you have n't written a single paragraph . If you find you do n't  post as often as you 'd like to on your blog , here are some fixes that you can try to write more each day . <h> Write your posts in the morning <p> Whether you think you are a morning person or not , research has shown that mornings are our strongest times for exercising willpower . All the choices we have to make throughout the day wear us out . By the time you get to relax in a quiet space in the evening , you 're more likely to flop down and watch TV than craft a great blog post . Get up earlier in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but struggle to get round to . <h> Turn it into a habit <p> Write every day ( or at least , most days ) at a set time and you 'll build a habit . That means you do n't  even think about whether or not you will write . You just do it . It takes a bit longer than the 21 days that many people believe habit formation takes , but once you have established it , you 'll watch your blogging productivity soar . Even better , it does n't  have to be every single day you can take weekends off if you prefer . <h> Set daily word count goals <p> As part of building the habit of daily writing , its also good to set a daily word count goal . Its important to set a realistic goal that will make it likely that you 'll be able to achieve your daily goal so you continue it throughout the year . You might also want to write that book while you 're creating more blog content as well . <h> Take notes <p> Have you ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful blog post ? Then when you actually get around to sit down to start working on your blog , you no longer remember what that great idea was ? This should never happen . Get into the habit of using your phone or a notebook to record sudden ideas , and expand on them a little so that you can re-discover your inspiration . That way , you wo n't find yourself thinking " What on earth did I mean by that ? " when you consult your little memo . <h> Write first , edit later <p> Do n't  interrupt the flow of your thoughts by pausing after every sentence or paragraph . Get your ideas fully roughed out and then go back to edit . That way , you wo n't lose your inspiration while you wrestle with typos , check your spelling and adjust your fonts . <h> Get some exercise before you begin <p> Exercise makes you alert and improves your concentration it also stimulates creative thinking . Does that sound crazy ? Researchers have found that people performed better in creative thinking tests after going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you adopt this habit many famous artists and writers habitually took a brisk walk before settling down to write . <h> Take breaks <p> A 30 second break can improve your mental clarity by up to 13% , and a two-minute break every half hour or so can work wonders for your productivity . Just looking up from your computer screen every now and then will reduce your fatigue . So if you want to be more productive take short , regular breaks . Stretch . Take a few deep breaths . Return to your writing feeling refreshed and alert . <h> Plan your distractions <p> While you 're researching your post , you may come across some interesting websites . Bookmark them for later rather than checking them out right there and then . Social media and email can also provide hours of distraction . And its not just a matter of sharing the occasional Facebook post or sending a Tweet . By the time you return to your writing , it will take a few minutes before you can get your thoughts back on track . Try the Pomodoro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can then schedule your planned distractions or use them as rewards during your short breaks . <h> Plan before you start <p> Draw a mind-map or rough out your subheadings before you begin writing . Not only will your work be more structured and have a good , logical flow , you 'll save yourself from losing the blog posts focus and having to delete chunks of irrelevant writing that does n't  have much to do with what you 're trying to get across . <h> Research before you write <p> Instead of researching while you 're actually writing , try to do all your online research before you even begin . You can copy-paste relevant paragraphs under your sub-headings so that you do n't  have to look through umpteen open tabs to find the nugget of information you wanted to include in part of your article . This should make the blog writing smoother and help you get the post done in less time . <h> Choose a quiet uncluttered environment <p> Have you ever noticed how easy it is to get a lot of work done in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work wonders . Keep this in mind when choosing your workspace for blogging . You cant possibly be productive with the TV on , kids demanding attention and chores staring you in the face whenever you look up from your work . Some people are better able to tune out noise and distractions than others , but you still wont be at your most productive . Find a distraction-free place to write and make that your writing area each morning . <h> 6 comments <p> I want to write 1000 words a day , but no matter how hard I try , I never seem to be able to get to that number . I always fall short . All my friends seem to be able to write that amount with ease . I 'm the only one who is a failure . What am I doing wrong ? <p> Do n't  try to start writing it all at once . Choose a number that is a bit lower . When you consistently meet that on a daily basis , set the goal a little higher . It takes practice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you set out to do it step by step with small weekly improvements , you should be able to eventually reach your 1000 words a day goal . <p> I think one of the main reasons people fail at blogging is because they simply do n't  write enough to be successful . Writing every day , or at a minimum of several times a week , is not easy . You have to make a concerted effort to be able to produce quality content on a regular basis , and that requires you to be productive as much is possible when you are working on your blog . All of the above may not apply directly to you , but if you can find one or two things that do help you become more productive in your writing and blogging , then you come away in a better position to get more done . That 's what I try to do with every article I read . Try to take a nugget that you can use in your own life to make it easier better . <p> Always do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense or do not grab your attention while reading , so make sure to do your research before posting on a subject .

Its a constant struggle and I 'm always looking for new suggestions on how to increase my productivity . Thank you for the tips . I hope to incorporate some of them to be more productive and to stay motivated . <p> I think when it comes to blogging you need to make it a habit and actually post quite frequently . Then again , also not too much . You have to find that happy medium . Choose a set time of day that you can stick to and post daily or even twice a day . 
@@12747181 @1347181/ <h> Why You Should Avoid Writing for Content Mills <p> Many freelance writers work or have worked for a content mill at some point . Many have regretted the experience . Content mills are websites devoted to posting tons of articles on almost every subject imaginable ( and some that are n't  , see number six , below ) . Quality standards vary and most pay very little for the work required . While some writers hope that content mills will help them break into freelancing or be a way to make some extra cash , both are unlikely . There are many good reasons to shun the mills . Here are some of the best : <h> Paltry pay <p> There are two issues with this . First , content mills pay pitiful rates , some as low as a penny per word . This means that a 700-word article would only net you $7.00 . The federal minimum wage is higher than that . To make just $20,000 a year you 'd have to write 2,857 articles . That 's nearly eight articles per day . Every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one per hour , that 's an eight-hour workday every single day of the year . And youd still only make $20K . There are much better ways to make money . <p> Second , the low pay of content mills contributes to a growing problem for writers : The desire of content providers to get quality work for low pay . When other content providers see the mills paying such paltry rates they figure , " Hey , why should we offer more ? The low pay model seems to be working for them . " It gets harder for writers to command the rates that they deserve when there are so many low paying markets out there having no trouble filling writing positions . Stick up for yourself and your worth and refuse to work for less than you legitimately deserve . <h> The mills stifle creativity and quality <p> Content mills are oriented toward one thing : Search Engine Optimization , or SEO . This means that your articles will be crammed with specific keywords that will try to bounce that article to the top of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to do this well and still produce a high quality , creative article . Youll be churning out work that fits a very narrow set of requirements . There 's no room for your unique voice or any facts or issues that deviate from the narrow focus required by the mill . <h> You probably wont gain any respect <p> Some writers believe that the mills are a way to " break in " and gain writing credits that can be parlayed into higher paying gigs . This is rarely the case . Because these pieces are rarely your best work ( written quickly , skimpy on details , etc. ) , you may not even want to submit them as credits . And even if you do , most reputable , higher paying markets will not view them as quality credits . You may be able to get away with listing some content mill pieces in an otherwise robust portfolio of work , but as your sole credits those pieces will not gain you the respect you need to get ahead . <h> Hoop jumping <p> You 'll likely have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audition piece , articles have to go through an approval process before being accepted , there may be a probation period where you have to submit articles but you wo n't get paid , etc . ) . You may play their game and go through all of their processes and still not get paid or hired on as a contributor . You 're probably better off writing for publications that have much clearer acceptance and employment processes . <h> Frustrating guidelines <p> Many content mills have a lot of guidelines for their writers , and some are not clear or are ever changing . For example , they may place limits on the sources you can use for research to keep you from using competing publications . However , you may not be provided with a list of banned sources until your turn in an article that includes one . Then your article gets rejected . You probably wont work with one editor all the time , either , and each one may have a different set of expectations and standards . What is accepted by one may be denied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formatting may be another area where one segment of the site follows one set of rules while another follows something else . These formats may not be expressed clearly in the beginning leading to more rejected articles . Sometimes it can feel as if the mills are doing everything they can to make your job harder . <h> You may end up churning out ridiculous , nonsensical work <p> Content mills often come up with the title and then expect you to write the article to match . Since most of the sensible titles have been used , you get some strange titles that are largely just hot SEO keywords lumped together . They may make no sense at all and there may be no way to write an article that makes any sense . Writing about " Clay Aiken The Pokemon Earthquake " would be a stretch for even the most gifted writer . <h> You 're not building a network that you can draw upon later <p> When you 're writing for the mills , you 're not working with reputable professionals who can help you make contacts or navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , and editors that garner respect in the writing world . They wo n't make useful references or help you further your career . <h> You do n't  care , and it shows <p> Writing for a content mill is about one thing : Generating a lot of words quickly . It does n't  matter whether you care about the topic or not . It does n't  matter whether you know anything beyond the basics or not . All that matters is the words . As a result , the articles show no passion and no depth . They read like what they are : Something rushed together without a care about the subject . If you want to be known as a writer who writes compelling , accurate , engaging , and informative pieces , a content mill is not for you . <h> You 're not learning anything <p> There are no professional editors helping you polish your work and teaching you how to become a better , more engaging writer . They may check for basic grammar and spelling errors , but that 's it . You 're not learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most basic information off a list of pre-approved sources . You 're not learning how to market your work because the site is doing that for you . You 're not learning any of the skills that a professional writer needs to succeed . All you 're learning to do is write to a specific formula that is useless in any field other than the content mills . <h> The ratio of time to money is way off <p> You 'll spend the better part of a day churning out an article that might pay you $5 . Even if you 're super fast at writing and researching , you 're still going to put in a lot of time for very little money . Time is the one resource you cant get back . Its generally better to spend your time working on things that will grow your " brand " as a writer and lead to better paying work .

You start out just trying to bridge the gap so you can make rent this month or put aside a little fun money . Before you know it , though , you 're working day and night for the mills because you need the income . You think you 're making some sort of progress in your career , but all you 're really doing is wasting time that could be better spent putting together higher quality gigs .

It becomes a vicious circle . <h> Opportunity rarely knocks <p> When you write for reliable , reputable publications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People see your work and ask you to write for them , or ask if they can obtain the rights to publish your piece elsewhere . This does n't  happen with the mills .

They can terminate your account at any time and for any reason . They can refuse your article for any reason and not pay you . As a professional freelancer , you should have more protection than this . Most legitimate freelance projects come with contracts that cover what happens in the event your article is rejected or needs more work , the editors/owners change , etc .

" 10 sensational ways to fight fat " might sound exciting , but if your diet and exercise tips are n't  sensational , your reader will feel cheated . <h> Why should someone read your post ? <p> Think about it . If you ca n't think of a reason for someone to want to read your post , you should probably choose another topic . You 'll see this principle in action in titles that pose a question or include questioning words like why and what . For example , " Why you should eat avocados to lose weight " or " What you need to know about income tax " are way better than " Avocados for weight loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of peoples curiosity <p> Curiosity is a wonderful thing , and you can use it to your advantage . Do n't  distil your entire articles contents into the title and first paragraphs . Create a " read on " moment by stimulating curiosity and leading your reader to want more . <p> You 'll see this a lot in sales copy . Therell be a sensational headline " Get mega-conversions on your e-commerce site with this clever strategy " it trumpets . Then the writer builds suspense : " What if I told you that the worlds top 5 e-commerce providers have one thing in common ? " and so on , before delivering the coup de grace the actual strategy he or she is talking about . <h> Titles may be all the reader sees <p> Think about your own search habits . You enter the keyword and get gazillions of search results . You scan the titles for promising-looking content before you even bother with the meta-descriptions . If the title of an article or post does n't  interest you , your eyes just slide off it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant and interesting . <h> Entertaining or thought-provoking <p> People are n't  only looking for information online they also want to be amused , entertained or interested . Use plays on words and humor cautiously though a sense of humor failure is a common phenomenon online ! <h> Curveballs and controversy <p> Taking a stance that 's outside mainstream of public opinion can generate a lot of interest and interaction , but once again , you do need to be cautious . If you 're going to be controversial , expect some flak and be prepared to have thick skin on the comments that will come in . Still , you will have people reading your article which is better than nobody reading it at all . <h> 4 comments <p> Off the top of my head , the one I remember years later is " The Salary That Will Make You Happy ( Hint : Its Less Than $75,000 ) " since many people believe that they need to earn a lot more than that to be happy . In fact , I would say the majority of my friends still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be happier than they are now , but studies show that that 's not true . <p> I used to think that titles werent that important until I started a blog . I started to see that some articles that werent particularly well written compared to others would get a lot more hits . It soon became apparent that a good title could make or break an article no matter how much time I spent writing it . If you want people to visit your blog , spend more time on your titles to make them the best they can be .

As more people found it , we started to get requests of what the users would like to see added to the tool . Over the years , we have added many of these suggestions . We continue to strive to keep this tool updated and to add new features which users have requested which make word counter more beneficial to all . We recently added the following features which you can now use : <h> Spell and Grammar Check <p> We 've added a button to the top left of the Word Counter tool which says " Spell Check " Once you have finished writing , you can click this button and a spell and grammar check will be performed on what you have written and will highlight areas of the writing that may be grammatically incorrect or have spelling issues .

The " Case " button just to the right of the " Spell Check " button gives you four options to display your writing in different ways . There are two ways to use this . You can highlight a certain portion of your writing , and only the highlighted portion will be affected by your choice . For example , if you highlight your first paragraph and choose " Uppercase , " then only the first paragraph will be turned to upper case and the rest of the writing will remain as it was .

For example , the title of this article , " Title capitalization , spell check and more new word counter tools " gets transformed to " Title Capitalization , Spell Check and More New Word Counter Tools " when the title case option is used . <p> Sentence Case : This options will turn all the writing to a typical sentence construction .

@@12747187 @1347187/ <h> Month : October 2016 <p> If you 're lucky , you know someone who can act as your editor , but most of us end up having to edit- our own editing . There 's just one problem : its really hard to spot mistakes you made yourself . You might think some commercial editing software can help you , and although I 'll admit some of these are pretty good at picking up certain errors , none of them will find them all . You can believe me . I 've tried a lot of them with hope in my heart . To test them , I feed them work I know is packed with errors , and I still have n't found one able to find all of them . I guess this leads me to my first piece of advice : <h> Never Trust Editing Software <p> Its actually quite comforting to know there are some things a machine ca n't do effectively : writing is one of them , editing is another . Do n't  rely on spell checkers , grammar checkers or any other writing programs to catch all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain will never be made redundant by a machine . The Matrix needs us . <h> Let It Lie for a While <p> The worst possible time to try and edit something you 've written is right after you write it . I find the greater the distance in time between me and my written work , the more effectively I 'm able to edit it . Its as if it becomes someone elses work . I can read it impartially and with fresh eyes , picking out mistakes I previously missed . 24 hours is the absolute minimum , and 48 hours is even better . Do I practice what I preach ? Ahem <h> Read It Aloud <p> Yes , I know it feels dorky . Just pretend you 're a TV news reader or the narrator for a documentary . Put on your best " announcer " voice and read it as if it were a script . You can also have a program read it to you with the Word Counter proofread feature . ( If you do n't  see it above the text area , go to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does anything make you falter ? Are there sentences that sound weird ? Did you need to pause at a place where there was no punctuation mark ? These are areas that probably need tweaking , even if you cant actually put your finger on the reason why they 're wrong . <h> Trust Your Instincts <p> It gets harder when you 're editing someone elses work . You do n't  want to offend them by making unnecessary changes . Sometimes , things are said in a way you would n't have done it . Is it wrong ? Maybe not , but I 'd still advise an adjustment . When I edit , I cant always say exactly why I changed this or that sentence , but in time , I 've learned that my instincts are often right . Its better to make an unnecessary change than to skip a change just because you are n't  sure how to explain it . <h> Track Changes <p> When editing another persons work , track changes so they can decide if they want to accept your judgment or not . Then create a " clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) , and check again . I often find I pick up additional errors . Do n't  ask me why . Maybe one does n't  see everything the first time around . With your own work , there 's no need to track changes , but the final proofread rule still applies . <h> Look out for Ambiguity <p> You can be ambiguous without actually making a grammatical error . You know what you meant . Did you say what you meant ? Imagine you know nothing about the topic and are reading about it for the first time . Does it make sense ? <h> Pay Extra Attention to Long Sentences <p> The longer the sentence , the more likely itll contain an error . Have you put a comma where a period- would be better ? Is your thought presented in a crisp , clear way , or have you become tangled up in your own words ? <h> Does Everything You Have Written Contribute ? <p> When writing an essay , you 're trying to get a point across . Anything that does n't  actually contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be a reason for everything you have said . You could be contributing to the atmosphere or providing background , but if what you 've said does not contribute something , its just padding that waters down your prose . <h> Beware of Punctuation <p> Its worth studying how to use punctuation marks . Commas , semi-colons , colons and dashes are often used incorrectly . Have you used them correctly ? When in doubt , check . If you 're still not sure , rephrase . <h> Know Your Vices <p> When editing your own work , its good to know what mistakes you commonly make . Since you probably make them without even realizing it , have someone who knows their stuff give some of your writing a look over to point them out . Ask questions and learn to identify your slips . You 'll probably find your slips a few times before the lesson sinks in . <p> Leo Tolstoys historical novel on the Napoleonic invasion of Russia has become a byword for long books . If someone talks about doing something in the time it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they mean its going to take quite a long time , and if your teacher comments that he or she wanted an essay from you , not War and Peace , your essay was way too long . <p> War and Peace is considered Tolstoys masterwork and a significant contribution to literature , but I must admit that though I 've tried a couple of times , I 've never made it through the whole thing . The philosophical passages that make up much of the book are heavy going . If you have read this book , give yourself a medal and a pat on the back . You deserve it . <h> How many words are there in War and Peace ? <p> War and Peace has 587,287 words , making it more than ten times longer than your NaNoWriMo novel . Tolstoy completed his first draft in 1863 , but he later spent three years rewriting most of it . One would think after spending so much time on one book , Tolstoy would have been too exhausted to write anymore , but he went on to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as several other novels . <h> Is War and Peace the longest novel ever ? <p> Remembering War and Peace was written as a four-volume set with two epilogs , its fair if we include some series . If we do that , we come across several famously lengthy stories . The Harry Potter series consists of more than one million words . The word count for the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan takes the record : 4,410,036 words ! Just imagine writing more than four million words . <p> Did you think that The Lord of the Rings would be near the top of the list ? Think again ! Tolkien managed to write his classic in " just " 481,103 words . If its one of your favorites , you now know something about it that you did n't  know before . <h> How Heavy Is War and Peace ? <p> The actual weight of the book depends on the edition and whether or not its paperback or hardback . As the above photo shows , the hardback version can weigh almost 4 pounds ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperbacks would weigh much less . <h> How Many Pages is War and Peace ? <p> The 587,287 words in War and Peace end up being 1,215 pages . Again , the page number will vary from edition to edition due to different sized pages and print used . <h> Translating War and Peace <p> Tolstoy was , of course , a Russian author , so for us to be able to read his novel , it first had to be translated into English . This was done for the first time in 1885 by Clara Bell , who translated it from the French version . This re-translated translation was far from perfect , and ten further translations into English have been done since . <p> War and Peace has been translated into German , French , Spanish , Dutch , Finnish , Swedish , Korean , Albanian and Czech . You must respect all these brave translators ; what a massive job to tackle ! <p> Interestingly , a large portion of the book is written in French , but at the time , the nobility in Russia often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them could barely speak Russian . <h> Is War and Peace a novel ? <p> Tolstoy himself said his book was not really a novel in the truest sense of the word . Although he has woven fictional characters into the narrative , he carefully researched real-life events by interviewing people and reading first-hand accounts of the French invasion of Russia . Only the first half of War and Peace deals with fictional characters ; the rest consists mostly of essays on war , power , and history . <p> Tolstoy did n't  agree with the way military history is recorded and tried to get closer to the real events by portraying them through the eyes of real and fictional characters . The names of over 160 people who lived during that time are mentioned in his work . <h> What makes Tolstoy so special as a writer ? <p> Apart from having written an extremely long book , Tolstoy was admired for his writing style . Just as movie cameras give us an overview of a scene , pan in , and pan out , so Tolstoy took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of his characters and back again . This style of writing was relatively new , and Tolstoy is considered to be its master . In addition , he wanted people to be able to accurately visualize scenes , so he included a wealth of detail . <p> In the last part of his book , where he increasingly looked at philosophies and facts , he managed to weave his essays into the story . Some abridged versions have taken these , and the second part of the epilog , which consisted solely of essays , out . <p> Is it literary sacrilege to edit Tolstoy ? Well , its a long book , and not all of it is really a " story . " Even when Tolstoy was still alive , abridged versions of his work were produced , presumably with his permission . <h> A little more about the man behind War and Peace <p> Tolstoy was born Lev Nikolayevitch Tolstoy in 1828 . He was born into the privileged aristocratic class and had the title of Count . In his younger days , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , his travels , and his reading led him to a spiritual crisis and reawakening . He became a fervent Christian and a pacifist whose works inspired the likes of Gandhi . He died in 1910 at the ripe old age of 82 . <p> Today , I am here to set you free from one of the shibboleths of grammar . You will be liberated ! I certainly was . At school , we were taught you should never , ever , under any circumstances start a sentence with a conjunction . That rules out starting sentences with either " and " or " but " when writing . I faithfully learned the rule . I became positively angry when I read books in which otherwise excellent writers seemed to make this faux pas . How could they be so sloppy ? <p> One day , I decided to settle the matter once and for all . I would find an authoritative reference to back up what I had learned , and I would send it to someone who had just argued you can start a sentence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy <p> Once I started to check , I quickly realized I was going to be proved wrong . People , including some of the greatest writers of all time , have been starting sentences with " and " and " but " for hundreds of years . Of course , there are style guides that discourage it , but its perfectly acceptable to begin a sentence with " but " when writing . I was thrilled ! That very day , I started peppering my writing with sentences starting with conjunctions . But one shouldnt go overboard ! See what I did there ? Hah ! <p> Using any stylistic quirk too frequently spoils your writing . By all means , start sentences with " but " from time to time , but remember that " but " also belongs after a comma . I did it again , did n't  I ? <h> When Should You Consider Starting a Sentence With " But " ? <p> " Contrary to what your high school English teacher told you , there 's no reason not to begin a sentence with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentence more forceful and graceful . They are almost always better than beginning with however or additionally . " ( Professor Jack Lynch , Associate Professor of English , Rutgers University , New Jersey ) <p> Thank you , professor ! I 'll admit to using " however , " but being lazy , I really do prefer the word " but " to begin a sentence when given a choice . " Additionally " is just awful , and I flinch every time I start a sentence with it . It seems so pompous ! <p> The professor also confirms starting with the conjunction can make your writing more forceful . Remember , you do n't  always want to be forceful . Sometimes sentence flow is more appropriate . But a choppy " but " at the start of a sentence certainly does seem to add emphasis when that 's what you 're looking for . <h> People Are Going to Argue This With You <p> Just as I once was a firm believer in the " never start a sentence with and or but " non-rule , you 'll come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where can they turn for confirmation and comfort ? The Bible is always a good place . Refer them to Genesis Chapter 1 for sentences starting with " and . " <p> For a sentence starting with " but , " you may have to read a little further all the way to Genesis 8:1 : " But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark , and he sent a wind over the earth , and the waters receded . " <p> Looking around online , I see some arguing that using the Bible as a work of English literature is pushing the envelope . I beg to differ , but perhaps as the worlds greatest bestseller , its a bit too commercial for them . Let 's take them to the real authority : the notoriously stuffy and pedantic , Fowlers Modern English Usage . Its seen as the authoritative book on English Grammar , and if they wo n't believe it , they 're never going to believe anyone . <p> If they 're trying to find a comeback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impressed with the reference you give them because I 'm ready to bet you anything theyve never have heard of Quackenbos ! <p> " A sentence should not commence with the conjunctions and , for , but , or however . " ( George Payn Quackenbos , An Advanced Course of Composition and Rhetoric , 1854 ) <p> Let 's sum up that argument , ladies and gentlemen of the jury . We have the Bible , a host of brilliant writers , and Fowlers Modern English Usage vs Quackenbos . I 'll see your Quackenbos and I 'll raise you an Albert Einstein . Oops , we 've gone from law to poker . Please pardon the mixed metaphors . Of course , Shakespeare also occasionally mixed metaphors , but well go into that another time , shall we ? <h> Why Were Students Taught This Non-Rule Rule ? <p> Why were we taught this non-rule rule about not starting sentences with conjunctions ? Several authorities seem to think it was done to prevent school kids from writing as they often talk : <p> " I went to my friends house yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we were there we saw a whole bunch of our friends . And they were just hanging out like we were . And because we did n't  have any money that was all we could do , really . " <p> Or <p> " But then John said hed had a birthday , and we could all go for ice creams . But when we got to the ice-cream parlor , he found that he had left his wallet at home . But that did n't  stop us from having a good time together while teasing John that he owed us an ice-cream . " <p> You have to admit , that 's a bit much . So to close , we quote Oscar Wilde , " Everything in moderation , including moderation . " <p> Mnemonics quite possibly got me through college . If you do n't  use mnemonics yet , you should consider doing so . This method is one of the best ways to memorize large chunks of information in an abbreviated form that triggers your memory . <p> Mnemonics can be acronyms or they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to remember things . Did you ever learn the rhyme : " Thirty days hath September , April , May and December ? All the rest have thirty-one excepting February alone ? " If you know the rhyme , you 'll always be able to remember how many days there are in any given month and you are already using mnemonics . <p> That 's quite a complex mnemonic . Most of them are much easier and shorter . In fact , they can consist of a single " word " or a sentence in which the first letter of every word prompts the memory . A mnemonic can even be a mental image you use to call up information . <p> How can mnemonics help you in your studies ? Have you ever noticed how difficult it can be to remember absolutely everything about a topic when under the pressure of answering exam questions ? Sometimes , we forget to mention things we actually know , and because we omit these points , we lose marks . What a waste ! <h> Remembering in the Correct Order <p> Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , but we also have to remember them in the right order . For example , if we are asked to list the planets of the solar system from the nearest to the sun to the furthest , we have to remember that Mercury is the closest , followed by Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and Pluto ( even though its no longer a planet , but that 's another discussion ) . <p> Thats nine things to remember in the correct order ! Is there an easy way ? Take the first letter of every planet name , and we have " M , V , E , M , J , S , U , N and P " . That does n't  make a word , but we could make a sentence in which each word starts with the letters we want in the correct order . You can get creative and make up your own sentence , or you can just remember this famous one : " My Very Easy Method : Just Set Up Nine Planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your rough work paper to jot down the first letter of every word , and from there , its easy to get 100% for that question . <h> Remember Keywords for Longer Answers <p> Essay questions can be challenging , and your teachers will be looking for several points in your answer . If you have mnemonics to help you , you 'll be able to remember all the information you should cover . How can you describe the topics you need to discuss using only one word ? Clearly , you need to pick out a keyword that will tell you what to write about in each paragraph . <p> As an example , business students might be asked what factors characterize effective goal-setting . There 's a common mnemonic that works for that . Goals should be SMART . The letters stand for : " Specific , Measurable , Achievable , Realistic , Time-bound " . Now you can write a paragraph about each of these characteristics and walk away with full marks ! <h> Making Mental Associations <p> This really depends on you and your frame of reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific word ? If something springs to mind , it can be a great way to learn and remember terminology or strange words . <p> When I was studying environmental science , I had to learn the Latin names of hundreds of plants . One of them , Wachendorfia thyrsiflora , is a plant that grows near water . It also has pretty flowers . How did I remember it ? Well , I called it " Washerwoman thirsty flowers " in my own mind , which means more than two decades later , I still remember the Latin name of this plant as well as its preferred habitat . Simple prompts like " sounds like a disease " can help you to remember complex terminology by association . <h> Pictures and Songss <p> Some people like to compose a picture in their minds or associate information with their favorite songs . In the end , whatever gets your memory triggered so that you can spit out the appropriate information on demand is just fine ! <p> When I had to learn the elements on the periodic table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song that went : " HHe ( said like a laugh , and reminding me that the first two elements are Hydrogen and Helium ) . Li Bee ! BCNOFNe ! ( exclaimed in various tones of voice ) " and so on . It was like a rhyme , and saying it made me chuckle , so remembering all those elements in the correct order was n't difficult at all . <p> You can use whatever nudges your memory , rings your bells , or blows your hair back . Learning to use mnemonics is actually great fun , and it makes taking tests much easier . It does n't  replace learning , but it does help you to remember all the things you did learn when you need to . Best of all , there are no rules . Ill even admit to composing a few mnemonics that were actually insults to some of my teachers . They never knew about it , and they still liked my exam answers . <p> Go forth ! Enjoy yourself , and I 'm willing to bet you 'll love the way mnemonics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet dogs , you have a paradox ( pair of dogs ) . Groan ! Alright , alright , I 'll stop trying to be punny , and I 'll take this question a little more seriously . Simply put , a paradox is a statement that seems to contradict itself , but could very well be true . I adore paradoxes because they often make you do a double-take after you read the words . <h> Examples of Paradox <p> here 's an example of a paradox . Someone says , " I 'm a compulsive liar , you know . " That 's an interesting piece of information . Do you believe someone who says that ? If someone is a compulsive liar , they wo n't tell the truth unless they absolutely have to . So , if they say they are a compulsive liar , is that a lie unto itself meaning that they really are n't  a compulsive liar ? I 'm going to stop even thinking about that one because my brain might go into a continuous loop from which it will never escape . I 'm getting a headache already ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature to make us think about something . For example , in George Orwells book , Animal Farm , the ruling animals tell us , " All animals are equal , but some are more equal than others . " In the story , the farm animals overthrow the farmer and take over the farm in order to be " equal , " but ultimately , a few of them end up with all the power . This allegorical story and the quote we just looked at illustrate the paradox of so-called social equality . We can claim it exists , but there will always be those who have an advantage over others . <p> Have you ever heard the paradoxical saying " I must be cruel to be kind ? " Sure you have ! What you probably did n't  know was that this saying is one of the many lines we 've borrowed from Shakespeares plays to use in everyday language . Although it sounds like a contradiction in terms , it really can be true . Sometimes we have to do something that people really wont like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Do n't  run away ! There 's nothing complicated about oxymorons , they 're simply words or phrases that contain a contradiction in terms . For instance , " bittersweet " is an oxymoron , and its also a paradox . <p> A crash landing is also a paradox if you think about it . Surely , you either crash or you land . How can you do both ? Nevertheless , we know the meaning of the term even though it seems to defy logic . The same goes for a near miss . If you nearly missed something , you must have missed it , right ? But this term is used to indicate a near hit ! <p> How about an escaped prisoner ? If someone has escaped , they are surely no longer a prisoner , at least for the time being . But instead of even thinking about how illogical this word combination is , we rush to lock all our doors if we hear that an escaped prisoner has been spotted in our neighborhood . <p> Then , of course , there are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I wont risk annoying the armed forces by agreeing with that , at least , not in public . <h> Everyday Paradoxes <p> Were confronted by paradoxes every day of our lives . How often have you seen an advertisement that says " Buy now and save ! " ? That 's a paradox . If you buy , you spend , and if you spend , you 're not saving . We know that they really mean you 'll pay less than you otherwise would . <p> Have you heard about " fighting for peace ? " It seems like a crazy idea . As long as you 're fighting , you 're making war , not peace ! However , if you are fighting against an army or organization that has caused a lot of unrest around the world , you really could be fighting for peace , paradoxical as it may sound . <p> When you discuss a hilarious comedy , you might tell your friends it was seriously funny . Paradox ! But it does n't  confuse them in the least . They go and watch the comedy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like seafood ? Next time you order up a plate of jumbo shrimp , remember to give the paradox a little acknowledgment . Shrimps are pretty small , in fact , they 're famous for it . But jumbo shrimps are , at least , bigger than other shrimps , even if they are still quite small . <p> I could go on we can call somebody a " nobody . " We might " act naturally " when were playing a hoax on someone , or we might remind someone that " less is more . " Look out for everyday paradoxes ; you 'll come across more of them than you ever expected . <h> Scientific Paradoxes <p> Did you know it takes more hot water to make cold water hot than it takes cold water to make hot water cold ? It really does . That 's why we run the hot water first when filling a bathtub . This is a very simple paradox , and there is an easily understandable reason for it , but there are much more complex ones . You 'll find paradoxes in astrophysics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even mathematics . No matter what field you study , you will come across paradoxes to boggle your mind and make life seem just a bit weirder and more wonderful . I think paradoxes are really interesting , which makes them fun . What do you think ? <p> Shakespeare , he s terribly highbrow is n't he ? And besides , its all in archaic English that we just do n't  use any more . If we were to go around quoting Shakespeare , people would think us pretentious or would they ? <p> The truth is that Shakespeare was the HBO of the times . He wrote entertaining plays for the masses and played on themes such as sex , murder , mystery , magic and politics . His work was the 17th century equivalent of " Game of Thrones , " except that the girls werent as gorgeous because the morals of the times forbade women from treading the boards as thespians . Yes , " thespians . " Look it up if you must ! <p> I can just hear people discussing the latest play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Yes , but it was the same old thing : sex and violence followed by more sex and violence . What , I ask thee , are we to make of the shocking entertainments of modern times , prithee ? " <p> " Methinks it should have an age restriction ! " <p> The popularity of Shakespeare through the centuries caused people to quote him , and today , we spout quotes and idioms from his plays without even realizing their origins . If you ever say any of the following , you 're quoting the bard . Even if you do n't  personally use these words , there 's a good chance you know exactly what the mean because they are used so often to this day . <h> Dead as a Doornail <p> " Look on me well : I have eat no meat these five days ; yet , come thou and thy five men , and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail , I pray God I may never eat grass more . " ( Henry VI part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bard was hardly being original . The saying had been around since 1350 , if not earlier . Would it have stayed alive without Shakespeare ? Probably not ! <h> Method in the Madness <p> " Though this be madness , yet there is method in it " ( Hamlet ) <p> And by the way , if you use the word " gunk " please give a nod to Shakespeare , who , in the same act , had Hamlet speaking of " eyes full of gunk . " <h> Out of the Jaws of Death <p> Unlike " dead as a doornail , " it seems this is completely original . There are no written references to this phrase before Twelfth Night ( 1602 ) . It certainly caught on , and to this day , we refer to the " jaws of death . " Its certainly an exciting story , complete with cops , pirates , bigwigs , and cases of mistaken identity . But I wo n't spoil it for you <h> We Have Seen Better Days <p> Did I mention Shakespeare also wrote comedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-splitter back in 1599 , and everyone was probably quoting bits of it and giggling like crazy just as we quote our favorite comedians today . Nowadays , saying you 've seen better days is n't even thought of as funny . Maybe the joke got stale or we lost the context . <h> Wild Goose Chase <p> " Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five . Was I with you there for the goose ? " <p> This quote comes from " Romeo and Juliet , " and it probably referred to a horse race of some kind , though how geese got involved in a horse race is beyond me . <h> Good Riddance <p> I do n't  have to give you the quote in context because that 's all it consisted of . It comes from the play Trolius and Cressida , " and it has been taken up by bands such as Green Day . We use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they offer to go away and leave us alone . <h> Fair Play <p> " Yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , and I would call it fair play . " ( The Tempest ) <p> Of course , we use this phrase in sport and gambling far more often than we use it in politics these days . Could it be that politics is n't even expected to play fair ? Let 's not even go there . I 'm sure it never was . <h> Lie Low <p> You know how it is : sometimes lying low is the best solution , and that 's just what Antonio in the play " Much Ado About Nothing " thought . <p> " If he could right himself with quarreling , some of us would lie low . " <p> Yes , I know people like that , too . <h> It Was Greek to Me <p> Have you ever said this after a particularly baffling lecture at school ? In the play " Julius Caesar , " Casca was equally baffled : <p> " Nay , an I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face again : but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads ; but , for mine own part , it was Greek to me . " <h> I Must Be Cruel to Be Kind <p> Again , we quote from Shakespeare , and this time , its Hamlet : <p> " So , again , good night . I must be cruel only to be kind . Thus bad begins and worse remains behind . " <p> I bet you did n't  even know that was an erudite quote . Mind you , as I pointed out before , Shakespeare was considered a bit racy , so you do n't  have to feel like too much of a nerd if you quote him habitually . <p> Apart from popular phrases such as " Be-all and end-all " ( Macbeth ) , " Break the ice " ( Taming of the Shrew ) , " Heart of Gold " ( Henry V ) , " Kill with Kindness " ( Taming of the Shrew ) and even " Knock , knock . Whos there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the continued use of certain popular words . " Puke " is just one of them .

" <p> This may not be the most important blog post you 'll ever read in your life , but it can teach you a lesson a lot of other people do n't  seem to have grasped , and prevent you from looking unprofessional when writing to or for people who do actually know the difference between effect and affect . <p> I 'm actually quite forgiving about the confusion between these similar-sounding but completely different words . I 'm willing to accept perfectly intelligent people are capable of little language vices , but not everyone has my forbearance , and your teachers ( and maybe your bosses ) are likely to pick up your mistake if you confuse these two words . It just makes you look a bit less intelligent than you really are when you mix them up . So let 's see how you can put your best foot forward by getting it right every time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effect ? <p> This little subheading is a dead giveaway and might even be enough to effectively teach this lesson . Here are a few more examples for you : <p> The effects of hard drugs affect a persons ability to succeed . <p> The storm had a negative effect on businesses and farms in the areas that were affected by the heavy rain . <p> He was powerfully affected by the special effects because he thought they were real . <p> What is the effect of the changes in the writing job market , and how will they affect you ? <p> As we can see , both words refer to the consequence of an action or event , but one , " affect " is always a verb , while " effect " is usually a noun . Sometimes , it can be a verb , but it is seldom used in this way . Take a look at these examples : <p> We will need to change peoples attitudes if we hope to effect change . <p> I hope to effect an upgrade in my standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an action that causes a consequence . You can remember the difference between " affect " and " effect " by bearing in mind that to be " affected " by something is the passive result of something else happening , while " effecting " something is an action in itself . <h> Cheats and Shortcuts <p> If you find that a bit hard to remember , just use " effect " as a noun . You can test this by putting the word " the " in front of it . If it works , you 're looking at a noun . For instance : <p> the effect . <p> the negative ( or positive ) effect . <p> the powerful effect . <p> All of these come from our examples , and we can see that they make some kind of sense , but now try putting " the " where " affect " is the correct word . <p> hard drugs the affect a persons <p> that were the affected by the heavy rain . <p> .. he was the affected by <p> It does n't  make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never a noun . <p> Do you need another trick to help you remember which word is a noun and which one is a verb ? Try this simple method to jog your memory . <p> Use any word ending in " aven " to help you remember . I can only think of three : <p> Haven <p> Raven <p> Maven <p> Choose whichever you prefer . Heres what it will help you remember : <p> A = affect <p> V = verb <p> E = effect <p> N = noun <p> Since " effect " is so seldom used as a verb , this little trick should see you through 99% of the time . For the 1% of the time that " effect " is a verb , remembering the active role it plays will answer the question . <p> Another way of remembering it is to remember that " a " comes first in the alphabet . You have to have an action ( verb ) before you have a reaction , so " a " will be a verb . <h> A Couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things off , well look at other contexts for " affect . " It can mean acting in a way you do n't  feel or putting on some kind of a show for the benefit of others . <p> I affected a knowledgeable air as I watched the incomprehensible presentation . <p> He has false , affected manners that really irritate me . <p> Fortunately only one of these bucks the system , and then it is n't working as a noun , but as an adjective . So now you know which of these words is which , and you wo n't get caught out again . Go to the top of the class ! <p> High school students often have a lot of confusion as to what exactly " intellectual vitality " means when they are preparing to write their all-important college application essay . What on earth are they looking for , and how can you show you 've got it ? <p> Relax ! Intellectual vitality is your curiosity about the world and your approach to discovering the answers to questions you have . It does n't  mean having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , its not so much a matter of what you 've got , but how you use it ! The key is to show them that you not only have a brain , but you also know how to utilize- it . Here are some ways that indicate you have intellectual vitality : <h> New Ideas Fascinate You <p> When you come across an interesting new idea , you cant leave it alone until you know absolutely EVERYTHING there is to know about it . Who dreamed up the idea ? How , when , and why did they come up with it ? How can it be used , and how well will it work ? How does it impact other things ? <p> You turn things over in your mind and look at them from every angle . No piece of information you process is n't put through a process of analysis , and you never accept information without first questioning it . <h> You Always Want to Know The " Why " of Things <p> After finding out the why , you do n't  stop asking questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  stop until you know a whole lot more , or even everything there is to know about it . <p> You know why you believe what you believe and do what you do . <p> You do n't  just follow the crowd . You form your own opinions through rational thought , and you look at things from every possible angle . Once you 've thought things through , you make up your mind and take action . <p> You do n't  mind having your ideas challenged , in fact , you relish it . <p> You 're not someone who spends listening time thinking about what you 're going to say next . In a debate , you can argue any angle , even if you do n't  actually agree with it . You 're always interested in other peoples reasoning , and you 're not afraid to change your mind in the face of evidence . <h> How Do Your Write All That Into an Essay ? <p> Your college application essay is a chance to talk about yourself . The best way to do that is to tell little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person you are , By doing this , you have the opportunity to show this quality in your stories . <p> Its important to remember that whatever you decide to write about , be honest . Talk about real-life events and show your intellectual vitality by showing how you applied it . Do n't  try to make something up it will almost always come across as unauthentic . <h> here 's an Excerpt That Fits Me <p> " My grandmother always impressed me by knowing the names of plants . Aged 14 , I decided I wanted to know everything there was to know about plants . I soon found it was impossible ! Was I deterred ? No ! It was just what I always wanted , a topic that you could study for years , decades , even lifetimes , and still not know everything . That 's when I decided to study natural sciences . " <p> " To narrow my field a little , I decided to learn about edible plants , especially edible native plants . I used to horrify friends and family by eating strange berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) because I wanted to know what they tasted like , how they could be used , and whether there was a reason why they werent grown commercially . Often , it was because they either werent very nice , or did n't  stay fresh for long . " <p> Gosh , I 'm starting to enjoy this ! I could go on <h> What About You ? <p> Maybe you used to love taking things apart to see how they worked . Maybe you were even able to put them together again ! Perhaps you took on an intellectual challenge ( even a fairly simple one ) and worked tirelessly till you could be the best at it . Perhaps you identified a common problem and found a novel solution . Maybe you were your schools debating champion and could argue any side of any debate effectively . Only you will know what events and achievements demonstrate your intellectual vitality . <p> There are many ways to demonstrate intellectual vitality and include it in your essay . Just remember , the selection board does n't  want to know how clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think . <p> Show this by identifying times in your life when you solved a problem , discovered something , or became passionate about a field of learning , even if it does n't  relate to your coursework . Itll only be difficult to write about if you try to invent something . Its always easier to tell the truth ! <p> Good luck with your college admission essay . Have fun writing it , and show them what you 're made of by being yourself . <p> There is no firm rule that says an essay needs to have a set number of paragraphs , but an essay must be a minimum of three paragraphs . There are a lot of people who say an essay should be five paragraphs , but its an extremely limiting rule , and unless you 've been instructed to write a five paragraph essay , there 's no reason to stick to it . <p> As a rule , you 'll write your essay in three main parts . First , you 'll introduce your topic to your reader . Next , you will have body text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , you 'll have a conclusion that tells your reader what you were able to see after looking into the facts or thinking through the topic . <p> In its simplest form , an essay can consist of three paragraphs with one paragraph being devoted to each section . Proponents of the five paragraph essay say that the body text should consist of three paragraphs , but in reality , its fine to write more or fewer paragraphs in this section . <h> Guessing How Many Paragraphs Before You Begin <p> This is a rule of thumb , which means it wont always work quite that way , but its handy all the same . In academic work , your paragraphs are likely to be a bit longer than most of the ones you see in this blog post . On average , there are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph . So if you 'd like a guesstimate , you can assume that a 1,000-word essay will have between five and ten paragraphs . <h> What Points Do You Have to Cover ? <p> Another , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs you need to cover your topic is to look at the main points you have to cover in the body text . A paragraph contains all the ideas that support or explain a single concept . <p> When you are planning your essay , you will think of or research the main elements that are needed in the body text . It would be safe to assume you need at least one paragraph for each of these . Of course , if there is a lot of information to cover in order to explore each area , you may need more . <p> For example , if you are writing an essay on childhood development and exposure to technology , you will want to look into the physical , psychological and cognitive developmental effects of tech on kids . When you research this topic , you will find that there are contrasting points of view and researchers have identified several physical , developmental , and psychological effects of technology use in children . <p> Assuming five psychological effects have been identified , you can assume you 'll need to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth essay . But if both those who say technology is bad for kids and those who say it can be good have done a great deal of work on the sub-topic , you might want to make that ten paragraphs so that you can cover both sides of the argument and look into how earlier authors reached their conclusions . <p> Of course , if you have been set a relatively short word limit , you may not be able to go in-depth at all , in which case a paragraph for each of the main sub-topics ( psychology , physical development , and cognitive development ) will likely be adequate . <h> Essay Content Is More Important Than the Number of Paragraphs <p> Ultimately , your essay will be evaluated on the information you present , not on the number of paragraphs in the essay . Early in your academic life , teachers and lecturers may give you both a structure for your essay and a guideline on how long each part of the essay should be . I have seen essay instructions say how many marks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the total word count and allocate a percentage of words to each section based on the percentage of marks you can get for it . After all , if the teacher is allocating 80 marks for content in total and you can see 50% of the mark relates to a certain part of the essay , then 50% of your essays words should be devoted to that section . <p> Sometimes , you 'll just be given a topic and told to air your opinion . This gives you more freedom , but its a tad more difficult . The research will show you how many angles you should look at , and itll help you to find information that both supports and contradicts your point of view . To make a strong argument , you need to look at both supporting and contradictory information . <p> To avoid getting tangled up in one aspect of the discussion , you 'll have to decide how long it should be . If its the most important aspect informing your conclusion , you can spend a little more time ( and words ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs rather than just one or two . <h> Always Remember the Purpose of Paragraphs <p> Paragraphs structure information into sub-topics , and they make your work easier to read and understand thanks to the structure they provide . With careful advance planning , you 'll be able to work out more or less how many paragraphs you need to complete your essay . <h> How many paragraphs is <p> For those looking for a general rule-of-thumb , below are some estimates on the number of paragraphs there would be in an essay of different lengths based on an average length of 150 words per paragraph . Of course , the number of paragraphs for your essay will depend on many different factors . You can use the following information for a general reference , but do n't  take these numbers as literal .. <p> A lot of famous writers have published their work using pseudonyms or pen names , and the reasons they give for doing so are many . Back in the days when women werent considered bright enough to be serious thinkers and writers , many female authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more seriously . Fortunately , those days are gone , but there are still many reasons to use a pseudonym . <h> You 're Writing on a Controversial Topic <p> Some topics are extremely decisive and can cause a lot of anger from those with an opposing viewpoint . You may not want to start receiving the hate mail that comes with advocating certain views , so you may decide to generate a pen-name . For example , if you were to write in favor of atheism or are pro-choice , you might think it wise to keep your own name out of the equation to avoid being ostracized by friends or family members who do n't  share your views . There are those who say this is a bad reason to use a pseudonym , but I can understand the reason why some people would make this choice . <h> You Write in a Variety of Genres <p> People often buy books by authors they like because they think they know what to expect from them . As a result , authors sometimes use pseudonyms when they depart from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for the Harry Potter series , wrote a detective story under the name Robert Galbraith for this reason . Its definitely not a childrens book , so she obviously felt she should use a different name so people would n't buy her book with expectations based on her earlier work . <h> You Have the Same Name as a Famous Author <p> If your name is Stephen King , it would n't really be fair to raise expectations by publishing your work using your own name . Besides , you want to become famous as an author in your own right , so you may choose another name to distinguish yourself from another author . <h> You Do n't  Like Your Name <p> Some surnames are rather giggle-worthy , and sometimes well-intentioned parents saddle their kids with weird first names . Admittedly , if your work is good enough , you should be able to overcome this handicap , but if you think your name is so strange that people wont take your work seriously , you might consider choosing another . <h> Your Name Is Too Long or Hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire book cover , so you follow the example of Dennis Max Cornelius Woodruffe-Peacock and choose an abbreviated form of your name . In this example , the author went of the much simpler " Max Peacock . " The same thing is true if your last name has less than the standard amount of vowels and you do n't  want to hear it being mangled by readers who ca n't properly pronounce it . <h> You Have a Common Name <p> If your name happens to be John Smith or Mary Jones , you might decide you 'd like something a trifle more distinctive . Once again , your writing will be the deciding factor behind your success or failure , but its understandable you might feel you need a name that sounds just a little bit more exciting . <h> You Want to Separate Your Day Job From Your Writing <p> Writers are often secretive about what they 're up to , and not all employers will be enchanted if someone in a very serious line of work were to produce a racy novel . It does n't  suit their corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in your day job as a result of your writing activities . Other employers may simply feel your heart is n't in your job because your " real " interest is writing . It is n't really fair , but it does happen . <h> You Have Higher Writing Ambitions <p> Some publishing houses produce endless streams of formula-fiction , and of course , they need writers to make the stories varied enough to keep their readership interested . Romance series are a good example . There 's no formula that actually says what has to happen on each page , but the stories tend to be similar . Readers know what to expect . Nobody expects great literature . They just want their romantic story with erotic moments , a bit of conflict , and a happy ending . If you 're still hoping to write a serious novel , you might want to hide your pulp fiction persona behind a pseudonym . <h> Your Publishers Will Know Your Real Name <p> Whatever your reason for choosing to write using a pseudonym , you have to remember anonymity can only go so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , signing contracts and protecting copyrights ; and of course , you do want to be paid . You will have to give your real name , but you can add " writing as " in front of your pseudonym to indicate your public persona will be represented by a different name . 
@@12747188 @1347188/ <h> Tag : college admission essay <p> Writing a college admissions essay has become a prerequisite for entry to many universities . Its an opportunity for the selection committee to get to know more about you . Writing such an essay tends to be stressful for most applicants . Many will delay writing it , while others will spend days , if not weeks , perfecting their personal statements . <p> It certainly is a challenge summarizing seventeen years of ones life or more into a mere 600 words . You will want to come across as being intelligent and the best candidate without being perceived as arrogant . This post will provide you with valuable advice to help you to make a good impression when writing your college admission essay . <h> The Importance of Your Introduction <p> An important thing to remember is that the admissions officers are under a lot of pressure . They will have literally thousands of applications to go through . With limited time available to them , its crucial to immediately grab their attention and engage them . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal anecdote . By sharing a moment , you will be able to set the scene . You can reveal how the experience impacted your life and how it helped shape you into the person you are today . Explain how the memory has impacted on your life and explain why it made you choose the study direction in which you wish to proceed . <h> Think Like an Admissions Officer <p> Universities and colleges want candidates who will graduate and go on to become successful people . Having alumni who are making great strides in the world reflects positively on the colleges image . If the majority of students failed and dropped out of their college , this would not be a good advertisement for the educational institution . <p> With this in mind , you 'll want to show that you are a determined individual . You should convey the image of being driven , someone who is passionate , motivated and hungry for success . You need to let them know that you 're resourceful and willing to make sacrifices in order to reach your goals . <h> Tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression . That said , keep it simple . One of the worst mistakes you can make on the admissions essay is to use too much flowery language . Verbosity has its place , but a college admissions essay is not it . Throw away the thesaurus and write using everyday vocabulary . Remember , you are not Shakespeare nor do you need to be . <p> Colleges are flooded with examples of applicants achievements . There is nothing wrong with being proud of your accomplishments , but do bear in mind that this approach tends to be boring . Think outside the box and show some creativity . Blowing your own trumpet too much can make you come across as conceited and arrogant . If your achievement illustrates why you would succeed in your future studies or be a credit to the college , try to mention it in an understated way . <h> Be Yourself <p> The quickest way to spot a fraud is when they are writing about something they have no interest in . You wo n't impress the selection committee if you fake it . Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't  matter if you 've never climbed Mount Everest or gone sky diving . What 's far more important is you being able to honestly express your feelings and discoveries . In fact , being able to show this side is likely to be far more impressive to the admission officers than any individual claim you make .

@@12747189 @1347189/ <h> What Are Power Words ? <p> Little words can make a big difference as to how powerful and persuasive your writing is . Although some bloggers have tried to make long lists of power words , almost any word can become powerful . It just depends on how you use it . Power words forge an emotional connection , they indicate action and achievement , or they make people feel they 're right there with you . The reason you write has a lot to do with the power words you choose . <h> Power Words in Marketing <p> Let 's suppose I 'm a fitness expert and on my website , my slogan is " Feel good about your body . " That 's pretty strong already , but almost anyone can feel good about their body , even if they are overweight and a couch potato . <p> Let 's make that more powerful : " Feel good about your body again . " Now I 'm implying that you do n't  feel good about your body , but there was a time when you did , and that if you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my slogan says a whole lot more . Our overweight couch potato is less likely to say , " I feel fine about my body , thanks , " and is more likely to say , " Yes , I 'd like to feel good about my body in the same way I used to when I was trim and active . " <p> One word engages the imagination . In our example , those who know they used to feel better about their bodies than they do now will remember that , and maybe theyll want to experience that feeling again . They have a reason to read on to find out how the fitness training can help them . <p> Power words engage the emotions and the imagination in marketing . Have you ever noticed that marketers will say things like " This could be you , " or " Imagine " followed by some vision of loveliness that you definitely can imagine and certainly would want . <p> Other power words marketers love are " scientifically proven , " " innovative , " or " unique . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming suspicious of the most commonly used power words . <p> For example , when I see the word " innovative , " I 'm no longer convinced . 90% of companies will tell you that they or their products are " innovative . " How are they all innovative ? They may have some difficulty explaining . In fact , their business or its products may be very similar to their competitors . That means they are n't  innovative at all . <p> Instead of using the same power words that everyone else uses , put yourself in your customers shoes and ask yourself what words would have an impact on them . What emotions relate to the need your product is trying to address ? <p> Will you relieve your customers worries and fears ? <p> Will you enhance their status ? <p> Can you improve their social life ? <p> Will they be entertained or amused ? <p> Are they likely to have a better self-image if they choose what you 're selling ? <p> What words will bring the feelings behind these needs across powerfully ? Just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise your words imply . For example , I once did some writing for a guy who had an invoicing service . One of his slogans was " Get paid faster . " I 'm all in favor of that ! That 's powerful stuff ! I especially like " paid " and " faster . " But he proved to be an excruciatingly slow payer , even when I used his own invoicing and reminder service to bill him . Do I use it now ? Take a guess for yourself . <h> Power Words in Your Resume <p> When you 're writing a resume , you obviously have to be much more formal , but you still want to use power words . Its just the type of words that become powerful that differ . In resume writing , you want to highlight the things you 've done , so doing words become more important . <p> Most experts will tell you to start each sentence describing your work history with a past tense verb . For example , words like " achieved , " " designed , " " conceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded , " and " implemented " are all considered powerful when writing a resume . Some recruiters even have software that looks for them and draws them to HR managers attention . <h> Power Words for Writers <p> Its not just people selling their services as employees and those who want to persuade you to buy their products or services that use power words . Nothing could be more powerful than the carefully chosen words used in great works of literature . How do they sway your emotions ? Why do you get " sucked in " so you simply cant put a book down till you 've finished it ? Its the power words that writers use that make us feel as if were part of a story . <p> A good writer can stir us to want to make war or inspire us to love . They can make us laugh or cry , believe in their cause or identify with the feelings of fictional characters who never existed in reality . They can make us feel as if were in the midst of a bustling city or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . <p> Almost any word can be a power word , depending on how you use it .

Negative words are rarely power words . For example , think of the words " sloth " I do n't  think that anybody would ever consider the word sloth to be a power word . In this sense , power words ca n't be any word . On the other hand , if its a positive word , you can likely be used as a power word in some way . <p> Welcome to advertising 101 .

Well , you can if you want to , but there 's something special about handwritten letters . Let 's try and pin down the reasons why a stamped , addressed , handwritten letter means so much to a recipient . <h> It Shows You Care <p> Which would you rather receive , a love letter , or a love email ? I 'm betting the letter gets your vote . Why ? Because someone took the time to write it with a pen on paper instead of just hammering away at their keyboard . A handwritten letter says , " I love you enough to take the time to send my message the hard way . " <h> You Can Enclose Fun Items or Get Creative in the Margins <p> I love writing to my niece , and she loves getting my letters . Why ? Because I draw funny stick men in the margins and enclose little tokens like a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever managed to do that with email . <h> You Take More Time Over It <p> Write , write , write , hit " send , " add three PS notes because there were things you forgot to mention .

Its carefully thought through , and if you need a PS at all , its only going to be the one . <h> It Makes You Happy <p> No kidding . I 've often felt the satisfaction of dropping an envelope into a postbox . It feels good . research also says people feel that way about sending a handwritten letter . I should have guessed that , should n't I ? <h> It Makes Other People Happy <p> What 's in your mailbox ? Mine consists of bills , bills and more bills , a few junk mail items , and the occasional magazine I 've subscribed to . When I see an envelope that 's been addressed by hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a friend ( rather than my insurance broker who is notoriously anti-tech ) , I 'm smiling from ear to ear . <h> It Let 's You Practice Your Handwriting <p> Just about all the written work we do these days involves a computer of some kind . Desktops , laptops , tablets , clickety click and the job is done . Have you ever picked up a pen and felt clumsy ? Its as if we do n't  get enough practice writing with pen and paper and find ourselves confounded when confronted with the need to write by hand . So write a letter to a friend ; you 'll be glad you did . <h> Its the Best Way to Tell Granny You Love Her <p> So your granny knows how to text , and boy , she loves it !

Some of them wrote thousands of letter over their lifetime . Even if you have no ambitions towards fame , writing an old-fashioned letter is a fine tradition that will make others sit up and take note . <h> You Get Letters in Return <p> Do n't  you love getting proper letters ? Give and you will receive ! Its almost unheard-of to respond to a letter with an email ! And if your friend or loved one does that , you 're fully entitled to inform them that a proper letter will be welcomed . <p> I can think of an 11th reason to write a letter .

How I treasure that letter , even though both of these people are long dead . If that had been an email , guess what would have happened to it ? Yes , letters are far more likely to be valued , kept and treasured , even when its been nearly 100 years since they were written . So write a letter today , it may act as a connection with the future as well as the past . <p> This is something that everyone should do right this second . Do n't  even think about it . Go grab some stationary and write to anyone you 've been thinking about recently and do n't  stop until you have a letter written and ready to put in the mailbox . Just do it . <p> Your grandchildren , who probably are n't  taught to write or read cursive handwriting , also love to receive your letters , though it may take a little effort for them to read your " antique " handwriting and theyll write back ( sometimes trying to practice cursive handwriting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-addressed envelope &amp; attractive note paper !

@@12747191 @1347191/ <h> Tag : speculate <p> English can be difficult , especially when it comes to words that can be easily confused . A couple of examples would be who vs whom and further vs farther . Another combo that can get confusing is was vs were . <p> There are several reasons why you might be struggling to decide whether you should be using " was " or " were " in a sentence . The simplest of these is the conjugation of the singular and plural forms of the past tense of " to be . " While this can cause minor problems to those learning English as a second language as they study , first language English speakers usually have few problems with this . The most common cause of debate and confusion is the use of " were " instead of " was " in the subjunctive mood ( Well explain that below if you are n't  sure what subjunctive mood is . ) . Well cover both past and subjunctive mood topics in this article , and you 'll soon see just how simple it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the easiest of the choices you need to make , but it also gives rise to the problems that so many people have when they begin to use the subjunctive mood . <p> Singular : I was , he was , she was , it was BUT you were . ( Just to make things more fun ! ) <p> Plural : Its always were , regardless of whether were talking about " they , " " we " or " you . " So far , so easy ! But now well examine how this relates to one of the most common errors in spoken or written English : the choice of " was " instead of " were " in the subjunctive mood . <h> If I were / was a rich man the famous subjunctive mood <p> The subjunctive mood is used to describe or speculate on a hypothetical situation , and you 'll hear people using both " was " and " were " in this context . But only one of these is correct . Whenever were talking about something that is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose " were " instead . It does n't  matter whether we are referring to a single person or a group of people . As soon as we cross the border between reality and speculation , " were " is the only word to choose .

@@12747192 @1347192/ <h> Month : August 2016 <p> Compound words consist of two words which can be used independently , but when joined together as one word or with a hyphen , form a new word . The funny thing with this is it can be quite hard to spot compound words . Think about the word " airport . " It consists of two base words : " air " and " port , " but we are so used to using the word as one word , most of us do n't  really notice its a compound word . <h> Closed Form Compound Words <p> " Airport " is an example of a closed form compound word . The two words are joined together without a hyphen or a space . Some other examples of closed form compound words include : <p> Baseball <p> Windfall <p> Extraordinary <p> Metaphysical <p> Worldwide <p> Northwest <p> Stockbroker <p> Sailboat <p> Railway <p> Wildcat <p> Birthday <h> Open From Compound Words <p> These words look a lot like two independent words , but they are n't  because they describe a single thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words you are likely familiar with : <p> Flight attendant <p> Super tanker <p> African American <p> Light year <p> Post office <p> Real estate <p> Truck driver <p> Middle class <p> Attorney general <p> High school <p> Vice president <p> Think about it . If you took either the first or the second word out of the two-word combo , it would no longer mean the same thing . Is " little sister " a compound word ? No , it is n't . Take the word " little " away , and you still have a sister . You both have the same parents . <p> Now take " flight " away from " flight attendant " . Does it still mean the same thing ? No , it does n't  . A flight attendant has a very specific job . An attendant can be any person who attends to your needs . It is n't even necessarily a job . As for the vice president , he or she may be happy to be promoted to president , but that has n't  happened . <h> Hyphenated Compound Words <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds are always hyphenated ( jack-in-the-box ) but others may be hyphenated on certain occasions and are not hyphenated at other times . Sometimes , you may hyphenate for clarity . For example : <p> " Old furniture salesman " <p> " Old-furniture salesman " <p> In the first example , it is n't clear whether the salesman or the furniture are old . For all we know , the phrase may be describing an elderly salesman . Example two is clearer . We can see that the furniture is old , and we do n't  have to worry about offending the salesman by accidentally creating the wrong impression . <p> To a certain extent , its a matter of frequency of usage . For example , we are so accustomed to used car salesmen , that we would n't even wonder whether the word " used " refers to the car or the guy . Now check this out : <p> Example 1 <p> " She was a part-time teacher . " <p> " The teacher worked part time . " <p> Example 2 <p> " It was a very high-speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . " <p> " High-speed " and " Part-time " are known as modifiers . They modify nouns . When a modifier appears before a noun , you would hyphenate it . When it appears after the noun , you do n't  bother with hyphenating . <p> Other modifiers that are sometimes hyphenated , and sometimes not : <p> Five-yard-long <p> Fire-resistant <p> Short-term <p> Good-looking <p> Blue-grey <p> Second-rate <p> The decision of whether to hyphenate or not is based on the location of the noun these compound words modify . <h> When Never to Use a Hyphen ( plus exceptions ) <p> A word ending in " ly " will rarely form part of a hyphenated compound . Think about word combinations like : <p> Newly minted <p> Hotly contested <p> But when you are using a whole phrase as an adjective , you might use hyphens all the same : " The ever-so-slightly embarrassed salesman continued with his pitch . " <p> Compounds with prefixes such as " pre " , " post " or " mid " are usually used in the closed form : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of exceptions to this rule , so its best to check using a dictionary . If you are n't  able to check a dictionary , you can work around the issue . For instance , if you 're not sure whether " mid-June " should be hyphenated , you could also say " the middle of June " . As a bonus , this helps with word count . <h> Compounds That Always Have Hyphens <p> You can be sure of these ones . They are n't  nearly as hard to pin down : <p> Numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine <p> Fractions expressed completely in numbers : " Two-thirds " or " one-third , " but " a third " is a third and does n't  need a hyphen . <p> Self , Ex and All when used as prefixes will require a hyphen : " ex-president , " " self-expression , " " all-knowing . " <p> Style , elect , free and based will usually be preceded by a hyphen when used as suffixes : " French-style , " " president-elect , " " Chicago-based . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read on compounds will tell you that open versus hyphenated forms are complicated . Most of them suggest a dictionary check when you 're unsure , and I do n't  think there 's any shame in that . I find it pretty confusing too . Nevertheless , I hope this blog post will put you on the road to knowing when to use the hyphen and when you not to do so . <p> If you know your geography and have a basic understanding of the names of the languages spoken in European countries , this might sound like a dumb question . If you live in the US and you do n't  know much about European countries , you 're much more likely to be confused about these two words . Danish people come from Denmark , and they speak a language called Danish . Dutch people come from The Netherlands , and they speak Dutch . How much easier can things get ? <p> I recently read a blog post by a Dane that showed a surprising tolerance for the way these two countries are confused by Americans . The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't want that confusion to happen when booking a flight , since you 'd end up in the wrong country and have to book an ( admittedly short ) second flight . <h> Similarities Between the Danes and the Dutch <p> Apart from both words beginning with a D , there are national similarities between the Danish and the Dutch . Both countries are small and peaceful , which means they 're seldom on CNN Breaking News . <p> They also speak Germanic languages , although you 'd see many more differences between them than you 'd find if you compared UK , Australian , and American English . Its possible for Danes and the Dutch to find each others languages completely incomprehensible unless they 're written down , and even then they might struggle with some words . <p> Both countries are reputed to be full of healthy , blond , blue-eyed people , although having been there , I can tell you that this is a stereotype these days . But the riding of bicycles to get around is definitely no stereotype . I actually found the bicycle traffic more dangerous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many bicycles . That 's because both countries are remarkably lacking in anything resembling mountainous topography . <p> Last , but not least , there 's the preference for wind power , although windmills are more common in Holland . The Danes have acres of wind turbines , some of them standing in the middle of the sea , to generate electricity . <h> Differences Between the Dutch and the Danes <p> Apart from slight differences in geographical location and rather marked language differences , The Netherlands does n't  have LEGOLAND , which is of great importance to those who love LEGOs . Other differences include the amount of taxes paid and the average number of hours worked every week . The Dutch pay way less tax than the Danes , but the Danes spend fewer hours at work on average . <p> The Danes also have a very casual approach to authority . Children will call adults , including teachers , by their first names . The formal version of the word " you " is seldom used , even in business letters . Danes do n't  find this rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to use formal titles and the formal version of the word " you . " <p> Beer plays a big role in Danish culture , with special beers being brewed for both Christmas and Easter . Although the Dutch invented Heineken , they do n't  brew special , seasonal beers . <p> Historically speaking , these nations have very different backgrounds . The Dutch are known for their farmlands and always have been , but the Danes are famous for " going a-Viking " which involved getting into long ships and trading and raiding their way around the coastlines of Europe . <p> If you had grown up on the Irish coast in those times , there would have been absolutely no confusion between the Danish and the Dutch . As you saw the long ships approaching , there is just no way that you would have yelled out " The Dutch are coming ! " and if you had , you would n't have struck terror into the hearts of your listeners . The Danish nation , on the other hand , is proud of its Viking history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenland and are believed to have sailed to the Americas long before Columbus did . <h> Know your English Heritage <p> If you have English or Irish ancestors , there 's a very good chance that you also have some Danish blood in your veins . The Danes werent always hit-and-run raiders . They often established settlements in the countries they came across in their voyages , and England was even ruled by a Danish king Canute ( or Cnut ) between 1016 and 1035 AD . Your chances of having Dutch ancestors is much less likely . <h> Further Reading <p> Its worth finding out more about these two cultures . Both the Danish and the Dutch have some impressive achievements to their names . Perhaps one day , you 'll visit the Danish city of Copenhagen and the Dutch city of Amsterdam . Like me , you 'll probably be surprised at how similar many of the older buildings in these two cities are , and how different the two languages sound . If you 're considering traveling to Europe , I recommend these two cities .

One is the tried and true word game " Hangman . " In the unlikely event that you did n't  learn this game years ago , here 's how its played . <p> One player chooses a word and draws a series of dashes for each letter in the word . The other player tries to guess which letters are used in the word , and the first player fills them in with each correct guess . If a guess is wrong , the iconic image of the stick man hanging from a gallows begins to appear stroke by stroke . Rules on how the hanged man is drawn vary , but this generally allows for a maximum of 10 wrong guesses . <p> Do you want to defeat your friends at Hangman ? Choosing words that are difficult to guess gives you the edge . According to veteran players , the ones listed below are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has four letters , but its as tough as nails to guess . The reason why this one is so hard is that it includes two of the letters least used in the English language , namely J and Z. Be hated and feared by choosing this tough nut . <h> Buzz <p> This word makes use of the same strategy , and if your friends start to see a pattern , theyll begin by choosing a Z ending just to see if you 're still up to your tricks . Choose a few easy words before you use this one ! <h> Jazzed <p> By now , your friend is ready to throw their pencil at you and march off in a huff . Remind them that its just a game , while you secretly smirk at your own sneakiness in finding out which words are trickiest because you love to win at absolutely everything . By the way , " jazzing " is also a good choice as is " buzzing " and " buzzes . " <h> Words with Double Zees <p> Use your double zee words sparingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzz " and " dizzy " to your list , choosing as many permutations as your evil little mind can dream up . But you need more than just zees to make you a winner . <h> Hajj <p> As hangman word choices go , this one is absolutely brutal . Its success lies in the double J ending and the fact that unless your hangman partner is savvy about Muslim culture , he or she probably would n't know how to spell it . Unfortunately , there are n't  any other words with a double J ending , so that 's as far as you can go with this one . <h> Words with a Double F <p> " Faff , " " duff , " " buff , " and " puff " are words that will expand your strategy of choosing rarely-used and seldom-guessed letters . Once again , feel free to add plurals , put verbs in the past tense , and so on . <h> Words Containing the Letter X <p> Do you sigh every time you pick the letter X when playing Scrabble ? Turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " vex , " and " fox . " Other words with X in them such as " six " may be too easy because they 're frequently used words , so stick with the more obscure choices . <h> Obscure Words with Unusual Letters <p> Put the double whammy on your opponents with unusual words that also contain less common letters of the alphabet . Below are a few examples you can place into your Hangman arsenal : <p> Quetzalcoatl <p> Sequoia <p> Asexual <p> Livid <p> Chthonic <p> Zwieback <p> Phylum <h> Words People Struggle to Spell <p> If you 'd like a whole arsenal of nasty hangman words to make your friends hate you , look no further than words people often misspell . Even if they get several letters right , they may not get the correct answer . <h> Words with Y as a Semi-Vowel <p> Most people go into a Hangman game assuming there will be a vowel in the word you 've chosen . You can use this assumption to your advantage by choosing words that use the letter Y in place of a vowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that will likely frustrate your opponent to no end . You can also try pushing your luck with words like " hmm , " but it really is taking a bit of a chance , and you may just be accused of cheating . <h> Words Ending in the Letter Q <p> Choosing words that contain the letter Q will make guessing the word more difficult , but if you really want to take it up a level , pick a word that ends in the letter Q. Warning : if you decide to do this , the person you play with will likely start throwing random objects at you . <h> Hangman <p> I 've left the most annoying choice for last , and if you use this one , you had better have on your running shoes . By now , your friend is already questioning whether he or she wants to remain your friend . This is a good one to use when you 're ready to finish the game since nobody will want to play with you after you use this word . <p> We love spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive sport , but that does n't  mean all of us know how to spell . While many of us rely on spellcheck and autocorrect , this can sometimes lead to unintended issues . <p> Some words are plain tricky , and even our cousins in the UK ( which invented many of the tricky-to-spell words ) have similar difficulties . Words that are spelled phonetically present the fewest problems . Its the ones with strange letter combinations , silent letters and double consonants that are among the most difficult , and its hardly surprising that they give people headaches . <h> An Embarrassment in Spelling <p> " Embarrassment " with its double r and double s was chosen by British survey participants as the word they found most difficult to spell .

@@12747193 @1347193/ <h> Common Phrasal Verbs <p> A normal verb is just one word : go , see , eat or cry . However , a phrasal verb is formed by a phrase of more than one word . It is almost always made of two words : the verb and its particle , which often looks like a preposition but is n't . <h> Particles Do n't  Just Occur in Physics <p> For example , " count on " is phrasal , but " on " is not a preposition in this context . Its a particle . Why ? Because if I say , " I can count on you every day , " I am not saying that I use your body to do my counting not unless were really close friends and like to do silly things together . So when " on " is paired with " count , " a new meaning is created . The phrasal verb is actually an idiom , a special way of expressing an idea that is not literal . <p> The meaning of this sentence should be clear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day I know what to expect from you . That 's what " count on " indicates . <p> Another phrasal verb is " break up . " If you look at the literal meaning of the two parts , you might think it means to break an object into pieces . But when you use the words as a phrasal verb , you create a new meaning : <p> " I broke up with my girlfriend after 10 years because she wanted to marry a rich guy . " <p> Poor me and yes , I really am poor because she preferred a man with lots of money . Can you see what I 'm saying here ? I ended my relationship ; I " broke up " the boyfriend-girlfriend bond . This is a very common usage of " break up " ( and its in the past tense because it already occurred ) . But its not the only meaning of this verb . See this example : <p> " The students broke up when their teacher spilled milk all over his shiny new suit . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him clean it off ? Did they feel sad ? No way : not those cruel students . They laughed ! So here 's a second meaning of " break up . " Its much less common than the first meaning , but you will see it , especially in American English . Since the two meanings are very different , its easy to tell which one is being used from the context its in . With a little experience , you can get used to phrasal verbs with multiple definitions . <h> Can You See the Phrasal Verb in This Sentence ? <p> " I got away with looking in my textbook for answers while I took- the test . " <p> Is it " got away " ? Not quite . The phrasal verb is actually " got away with , " so it has three parts . Occasionally , you will see a phrasal such as this , but as stated above , they are generally two words . This is a great example of how to use " got away with , " because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being caught or punished . At the same time , this is not a recommended action . I am clearly a lazy student who does n't  want to study . I promise to improve . Here are two more sentences : <p> " I do n't  want to run into him by accident at the concert . " <p> " Let 's shop around to see which computer gives us the best value . " <p> Did you see the phrasal verb in the first sentence ? It is " run into . " Its simple to identify it . However , the second sentence has three verbs : " shop , " " to see " and " gives . " Wheres the phrasal one ? It must be " shop around . " Its the only one with a particle . " To see " is an infinitive . If you reverse it and write " see to , " you have another phrasal verb . So to identify a phrasal verb , always look for the verb first and the particle second ( and third , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the list of phrasal verbs . That helps me understand them a bit better . I 'm still n completely sure I understand them all , but the list helps me understand better than I did when I came here searching about them . <p> I find using phrasal verbs is an easy way to add or decrease word count depending on what you need to do for an essay . If you need to increase word count you use the phrasal verbs , but if you need to decrease your essays word count , you use the equivalent single word . For example , instead of using " get across " you can use " communicate " or instead of using " turn down " you can use " reject " Being able to substitute phrasal verbs with their singular word equivalent is an easy way to pad or decrease your word count for essays . <p> There are better ways to increase or decrease word count than using phrasal verbs . Doing this does n't  make your writing any stronger , and often will make it weaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than simply substituting words that mean the same thing . 
@@12747194 @1347194/ <h> Tag : maximum count <p> When you are writing an essay for a class which has a minimum of maximum word count limit , the question of whether or not footnotes and endnotes should be counted toward this limit can come up .

Which one is it ? <h> Footnotes <p> Do footnotes count when doing a word count ? No , footnotes do n't  count in the word count in most cases . When a teacher or professor gives an assignment with a minimum or maximum limit , its usually done with the intent of being applicable to the topic being assigned . Footnotes are auxiliary information that further clarifies certain points being made in the essay . Since this is n't a part of the body of the essay , most teachers and professors do not count footnotes as part of the essays word count . <p> This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the teacher giving the assignment , so the best policy is to ask the person assigning the essay whether or not footnotes should or should n't be included . If this is not possible , its best to assume that they are not counted . <p> Do footnotes count in a page count ? Yes , footnotes generally count toward page count . Footnotes are found at the bottom of the page and do n't  take up much of the page space in most instances . While its relatively easy to exclude footnotes from a word count , its much more difficult to exclude them from a page count . For this reason , most professors allow them to be included as part of the overall page count . <p> Again , counting footnotes as part of the page count is a general rule of thumb , not a definitive answer .

If you find yourself in a position where this is n't possible , in most cases it should be acceptable . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a word count in most cases . Much like footnotes , endnotes give further information to a point made in an essay but are n't  part of the body of the essay . For this reason , endnotes are generally not included in an essays word count . The best policy is to ask directly if you are n't  sure about this , but when in doubt , its better not to count them . <p> Do endnotes count in a page count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a page count most of the time . There is one significant difference between footnotes and endnotes which is endnotes are found at the end of the essay and not at the bottom of each page . Being at the end , its much easier to exclude them from a page count than it is to exclude footnotes .

If you have been working on a paper or a writing assignment for a long period of time , its easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally miss grammatical mistakes within the writing . One of the best ways to prevent this is to get someone to proofread your writing , since they look at it from a completely fresh perspective . The issue for many , however , is that there often is n't someone around who 's willing or able to proofread your writing . If you find you often miss mistakes when proofreading and cant get someone else to proofread it , there are a few steps you can take which will give you a better chance of catching your writing errors . <h> Walk Away <p> One of the best steps you can take when proofreading your own work is to take some time away from it , even if that is only for an hour or two . A full day or two is even better and one of the reasons you should learn to not procrastinate . When you try to proofread as soon as you finish writing , you still have it in your head what you meant to say , and this can often overwrite what 's actually on the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your writing with " fresh eyes " and- will make it much more likely you 'll spot errors . <h> Listen to Your Text <p> If you do n't  have time to walk away for a bit of time , listen to your writing instead of reading it ( you can use the proofread tool available on wordcounter ) . Switching things up so you listen to what you wrote instead of reading it will again will make it more likely you will catch your mistakes rather than if you reread the text . <h> Print and Read <p> Another way to increase the chances of catching mistakes is to print out your writing instead of proofreading it on the computer . Trying to proofread on your computer makes it easier to miss mistakes than when you proofread with the writing physically in front of you . <h> Read from Bottom to Top <p> An effective way of proofreading which- forces you to look at the writing from a different perspective is to proofread from the bottom to the top . Instead of proofreading as one would normally read the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wo n't make any sense , but that 's the point . It will force you to look at the individual words written , rather than skimming over sentences . <h> Read It Out Loud <p> Another way to increase your chances of finding mistakes when proofreading is to read your writing out loud instead of silently in your mind . Reading silently increases your chances of inserting skipped words that are n't  on the paper but you meant to write . Audibly saying the words makes it much more difficult to skip over these types of mistakes . <h> Do n't  Do Everything at Once <p> When you do sit down to proofread , do n't  try to correct all the problems in a single read through . Instead , concentrate on a specific aspect you want to make sure is correct . For example , concentrate on word choice for the first read through . Then concentrate on finding grammatical errors and sentence structure mistakes on the second read through . For the third reading , look specifically for spelling mistakes . Yes , this means you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a single time , but that will also make it much more likely you 'll find all the mistakes you may have made . <h> Use Spellcheck and GrammarCheck <p> Using a spell checker can help you spot words which have been repeated , words which have reversed letters and other common spelling mistakes , but you should never rely on it as the only proofreading you do . While a spell checker is great for its specific job , it fails at a lot of other things , especially when it comes to grammar . " There " is spelled correctly , but its still wrong if the proper word for a sentence is " their . " A grammar check can help out with these mistakes . Both are tools which can help you find errors- you may- miss on your own , but they do n't  replace actually rereading your writing and looking for mistakes . <h> Make a Proofreading Checklist <p> You know your weaknesses better than anyone else , and you should make a checklist of these weaknesses . This will allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you proofread . If you do n't  currently know your writing weaknesses , begin to pay attention to the remarks when you get assignments back so you can create the checklist .

Let us know about them in the comments . <p> When you 're writing an academic essay , or any written report for that matter , you may be tempted to wrap things up as quickly as possible . You may even be tempted to just leave your reader hanging as soon as you 've presented all the facts and arguments . If you do that , you leave your reader in a " Yes , so what ? " position which is clearly not the intention of any piece of persuasive writing . <p> Your conclusion paragraph joins the dots between your introduction and all the facts youve just presented , showing your reader the " take home " message you 're trying to get across . How should you write it to achieve this goal ? <h> I Already Wrote It ! <p> You may argue , " I already told everyone what I concluded in my thesis statement ! " That 's true , but at the time , you had n't  presented the evidence . Now you have to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just think its obvious and walk away . Your reader does not live inside your head . What is obvious to you may not be as obvious to everyone else ! <p> However , your thesis statement does form the basis of at least part of your conclusion . You can restate it in different words , but now you will flesh it out by relating it to all the information you 've discussed . <h> What Sub-Points Did You Make ? <p> To support your thesis , you 'll have discussed several sub-points . What were they ? Look at the sub-topics you discussed and determine how they contribute to the thesis . If they do n't  contribute at all , or you cant see the link , they should n't be in the essay ! Finally , you want to leave your reader with some food for thought , so your concluding paragraph needs to be good . <p> Did you know some people ( including your teachers ) will read your introduction , skip to your conclusion , and only then look at your body text ? Its a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so never think your conclusion is unimportant just because its at the end . <h> Let 's Look at an Example <p> " The United States entered the First World War because of German attacks on US shipping and to halt Germanys rapid expansion and growing military power which presented a direct threat to US interests and territorial integrity . " <p> Let 's assume that in our essay , we discussed the practical reasons why the US entered the First World War . We also looked at the moral reasons , and theorized these were highlighted by president Woodrow Wilson to gain extra support for the war effort . They may have been real enough , but we argue they were secondary to the provocation and threats we mentioned in our thesis . Now we have to tie up all the points . <p> " Although president Woodrow Wilson highlighted the moral reasons why the US entered the war , these had always existed , and had only seen widespread support from certain sectors of the community . With German submarines attacking and sinking US commercial shipping , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the war became more urgent . The Zimmerman telegram , which offered support to Mexico should it embark on a war with the US confirmed that Germany did not respect US neutrality , and indeed posed a direct threat to US territorial integrity . Although there were other factors that contributed to the decision , it was these two issues that finally tipped the balance . The US entry into the War to end all Wars , was a defensive move , and pragmatism outweighed morality in the final decision to enter it . " <h> Nothing New in the Conclusion , but Food for Thought <p> Our example is a little incomplete because I have n't given you the body text , but you should assume the essay discussed all the reasons for entering the war in detail . Each subsection of the essay may have had a mini-conclusion of its own showing why the information was included and how I think it contributes to the argument presented in my thesis . <p> My concluding paragraph sums everything up and shows how the information leads up to a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> Final Checks <p> As a semi-final check , I will consult my question . This may have been : <p> Discuss the primary reasons for the US entry into the First World War <p> Or it could have been : <p> Did the US enter the First World War for practical or moral reasons ? Discuss . <p> Or simply : <p> Write an essay on the US entry into the First World War . <p> The last check is done to see if all the information I have included in the essay contributes to the conclusion . There should be a mention , however brief , of all the aspects that were discussed in the body text . You have compiled a lot of information , and its up to you to draw it all together into a powerful conclusion supported by the facts you presented . <p> When you write a paper or essay , you must have a thesis statement . What is it ? Its a statement of your position or point of view . You 'll use much of your essay backing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generally explaining why you took this point of view . Remember , no thesis statement can be wrong as long as you have the evidence to back it up . <h> Do Your Research First <p> Choosing a stance can seem intimidating . How should you go about it ? The trick is to do your research first . Do n't  just choose a point of view and then try to manipulate the facts to fit it . Instead , look at the facts and see what you can conclude from them . You can then sum your findings up into one strong sentence that will tell your reader how you plan to approach the topic under discussion . <h> Where Do You Make Your Thesis Statement ? <p> Usually , you 'll write a paragraph introducing your topic , ending your paragraph with your thesis statement . For example , if your essay is about the reasons the US entered the First World War , you might begin with a few sentences outlining the pivotal role the USs entry in the war had and why it was so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eager to enter the war to begin with , and then you 'll end your opening paragraph with your thesis statement . <h> Be Sure Your Thesis Answers the Question <p> A thesis statement should be a concise sentence that shows how you 'll answer the question you have been given . As a result , your statement has to be a strong one rather than a vague one . For example : <p> " The United States entered the first world war for several reasons , some of which matched those of its allies , while others did n't  , " is a weak thesis . It does n't  give any specifics , and it does n't  explain what your essay is about other than saying its about the US entry into the First World War , which was presumably the question you are supposed to be answering . <p> If your thesis statement does n't  answer the question you were given , you have gone off on a tangent , and you 'll receive poor marks for your essay . Test it by reading your question again followed by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Your Views <p> Sometimes , you 'll be asked to present facts , and at others , you may be asked to give a personal opinion . Either way , you absolutely must understand the subject matter before formulating your thesis . Once you know what you 're talking about , you can create a thesis statement that 's free of vagueness or ambiguity . <p> " The United States entered the First World War because of German provocation and for internal security reasons , " is somewhat better than our first example , but its still a little weak . <p> " The United States entered the First World War because of German attacks on US shipping and to halt Germanys rapid expansion and growing military power which presented a direct threat to US interests and territorial integrity , " is a clear and unambiguous statement . <p> The former reason is the primary deciding factor , but American politicians also feared Germanys expansionist policies . The Zimmerman telegram , an intercepted message from Germany offering support for Mexico if it went to war against the US , confirmed that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from German ambition . As you can see , our thesis sums these two primary contributing factors up quite neatly , and the rest of the essay can explore these two points in greater detail . <p> Your thesis statement should fulfill the following requirements : <p> Tell your readers how you have interpreted the subject matter <p> Sums up what will be discussed in the paper <p> Gives a direct answer to the question you have been asked <p> In most cases you would make a claim that is up for debate . For example , some may argue that the USs intervention in the First World War was primarily for moral reasons . My thesis suggests that pragmatic reasons were the deciding factor , and I will support this argument with facts throughout my paper . <p> A thesis consists of one sentence , usually at the end of the introductory paragraph . <p> You may not be directly asked to formulate a thesis statement , but in general , you can take it as being an element that is expected . <h> Your Thesis Statement Will Undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your disposal , you may decide to change or expand on your thesis statement . That 's fine . Your first , second , or even third attempts may not be as comprehensive as you first thought . As one of the most important sentences in your paper , your thesis statement is worth reworking to make it as strong as you possibly can . <p> When in doubt , remember that your teachers are there to help . If they feel that answering your question would be unfair to other students , they will say so . It never hurts to ask if they feel your statement is strong enough . <p> As an adult English speaker , you 're expected to have an extensive vocabulary that includes some words that are seldom used in conversational English . You should also be striving to improve your vocabulary . While all these lists are somewhat subjective , they 're a good way to see how good your current vocabulary happens to be , and work on some words you may not know . See how you measure up to this list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just to make things more interesting , I 've also peppered a few rather obscure words into the mix , and even though these may rarely be used , theyll make you an even more dangerous Scrabble player , crossword whizz or other word game player than you already are . Enjoy ! <p> 1 . Acquiesce <p> This word means that a person has agreed or assented either verbally or tacitly to something . Even when it is well understood , this word is often misspelled . <p> 2 . Aberration <p> Sometimes , its good to be different , but the word " aberration " describes an unwelcome oddity . So , if someone accuses you of aberrant behavior , they are n't  complimenting your originality . <p> 3 . Abjure <p> If you solemnly renounce something , you have abjured it . The word is used in baptism ceremonies in certain churches . The person being baptized declares that he or she abjures Satan and all his works . <p> 3 . Abrogate <p> Abrogation is a situation in which formal or legal measures are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law or a formal rule that is repealed or temporarily suspended . <p> 4 . Acronym <p> This should have been an easy one for lovers of language . An acronym is an abbreviation consisting of letters . For example , U.S.A for United States of America . <p> 5 . Anachronism <p> I 'm sure you will have encountered a few anachronisms during your life . An anachronism is something that is out of date and no longer relevant to the times . If you want to argue that something has lost its relevance by not changing with the times , you can describe it as being anachronistic or an anachronism . <p> 6 . Anathema <p> No , its not a rather nice sounding girls name . It describes something that you vehemently dislike to the point of total rejection . For example : " He is an atheist ; all forms of religion are anathema to him . " <p> 7 . Antebellum <p> A thing that is described as " antebellum " was conceived or constructed prior to an important war . The plantation era before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antebellum era , but the word can apply to anything that preceded a major war . <p> 8 . Anthropogenic <p> Anything that has been caused by human interventions is anthropogenic . The word is usually used in the context of environmental degradation and pollution . Climate change , for example , could be described as an anthropogenic phenomenon . <p> 9 . Antithesis <p> Something or someone that is the diametric opposite of something else . " He was the antithesis of the frivolous millionaire playboy , " would imply that the person was the opposite of what one expect from a happy-go-lucky millionaire . Perhaps he was very serious about current issues , or did n't  like wasting money on status symbols . <p> 10 . Assonance <p> This is the sound a donkey makes . Alright , I 'm kidding again , but it does have something to do with sound . It is a technique often used in creative writing and poetry in which similar sounding ( but not necessarily rhyming ) words are used in close proximity to one another . <p> 11 . Benchmarking <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which other , similar things will be compared . For example , in vegetation surveys , undisturbed nature would be seen as the benchmark against which vegetation would be evaluated . <p> 12 . Bellicose <p> This is a lovely word for describing people who are aggressive and even willing to fight over an issue . As you can imagine , bellicosity and politics often go hand in hand ! <p> " Chicanery " alludes to the use of dirty tricks in the financial , political or legal world . If you are ever accused of it , know that you are in deep trouble ! <p> 15 . Chthonic <p> You really wo n't see this word in everyday use , but its a killer if you 're into word games ! It refers to caves or the underworld . It is a synonym for the more well-known " subterranean " . <p> 16 . Cerulean <p> You will no doubt have read about cerulean waters or skies and assumed that they were blue . You are right . Specifically , the word refers to a deep , sky-blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumspection , you are watchful , wary or unwilling to take risks . One could almost say it was an antonym or opposite for " bellicose " ! <p> 18 . Circumlocution <p> Have you ever talked to someone who explains things in a roundabout way ? They are guilty of circumlocution . They literally " talk around " a subject instead of being specific and concise . <p> 19 . Cogent <p> The person who is guilty of circumlocution , should try to be more cogent . In other words , they should be clear , logical and convincing . When you present arguments , you will strive for cogency . <p> 20 . Colloquial <p> This is the kind of language we use every day . It is the " spoken " form of a language , and is not appropriate when you are writing a formal text . That does n't  mean that colloquial words are wrong or bad . They are simply informal . <p> 21 . Conundrum <p> A conundrum could simply be a riddle , but it is also used to describe any puzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely word is used to describe things that resemble or relate to twilight . In its simplest form , it is used to describe creatures that become active at twilight , but I 'm sure you know a few people like that too ! <p> 23 . Deleterious <p> If something has harmful effects , they can be described as " deleterious effects . " You 'll often find this word being used in medical texts and in psychology . " Harmful " is just as good , but this word is ever so much weightier ! <p> 24 . Depredation <p> My mom used to use this word to describe my brothers activities in the pantry . It describes an act of attack or plunder . Judging from the state of the grocery cupboard once my brother was finished , my mom described what hed been up to very well . <p> 25 . Didactic <p> In its simplest context , this word describes something that was designed to teach a lesson . For example , a didactic story would have a strong lesson to teach . However , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachy and patronizing . <p> 26 . Egregious <p> Think of all the words that mean " terribly bad or shocking ; " that 's what " egregious " means . Never did a difficult-seeming word have a simpler definition ! <p> 27 . Enervate <p> If you are feeling drained , weakened and tired out , you have probably been through some sort of enervating experience . There are good types of tiredness , but this is not one of them . <p> 28 . Enfranchise <p> This means giving people freedom or the right to vote . Nowadays , we worry about disenfranchisement , a situation in which rights or freedoms are taken away . <p> 29 . Entomophagy <p> This word is quite rarely used , but if we were to have a famine , or if certain exotic dishes became popular , we might need it . It means " the eating of insects , " and although it generally applies to animals and birds , there are plenty of people who eat insects as a matter of course ! Any word with the suffix " phagy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats . <p> 30 . Epiphany <p> An epiphany is an " Aha ! " moment , but the word comes from the Christian festival celebrating the revelation of Christ to the magi . If you have a life-changing realization , it could be described as an epiphany . <p> 31 . Epitome <p> A perfect example of something epitomizes it . " Her life so far is the epitome of the American Dream , " makes me think , " Wow , I want one just like it ! " <p> 32 . Eschatology <p> A lot of people discuss this quite heatedly without knowing the right word for it . It is a religious doctrine that deals with death , judgement , and what happens to the soul after death . And in case you were wondering I did n't  know this word before I researched this article , but I thought we needed a few challenges . <p> 33 . Eschew <p> here 's a useful little word that says more than it seems to . For example , you could say someone does n't  exercise , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it implies a stronger and more deliberate aversion . <p> 34 . Evanescent <p> If you have literary ambitions , this beautiful word is worth having in your vocabulary . It refers to something that is transitory , or that disappears or fades rapidly . <p> 35 . Existential <p> The word structure says it all . It describes something to do with the nature of existence . If you 're into philosophy , you probably use this word a lot . <p> 36 . Exponential <p> There is a mathematical description of exponents and what can be regarded as " exponential . " I 'm not going to go into it here . We more often hear of it in a context that implies rapidly increasing growth . When you hear it , do n't  just trust it . Ask for the figures . <p> 37 . Facetious <p> This is one of my all-time favorite words , and I have frequently been accused of facetiousness . It means making inappropriate jokes or taking serious situations too lightly . I would n't say its always a good thing , but sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way too serious about unimportant things . <p> 38 . Fascism <p> What is it ? It sounds great in political arguments , and the word is often bandied about . It is a type of nationalism that sprang up in Europe in the 1920s , and it led to some pretty authoritarian governments that were known for their right-wing views and intolerance . If you want to know more about the deeper implications of fascism , read some history . <p> 39 . Fatuous <p> A fatuous comment is silly , inane , or just plain stupid . Save this remark for someone who really deserves it , and serve it up cold . <p> 40 . Fiduciary <p> If you encounter this word , it will be in a legal context . It is the term used to describe a trustee who takes care of assets on behalf of one or more beneficiaries . <p> 41 . Filibuster <p> The filibuster is a person who uses a dirty , time-wasting trick to hold up a legislative decision . Without breaking any rules , the filibuster speaks at great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old English for " pirate , " and it is not a good thing to be . <p> 42 . Fulminate <p> Let 's use an example : your teacher tells the class that the holiday assignment is a 10,000-word essay . After class , everyone discusses how furious they are , how unfair it is , and so on . They are , in fact , fulminating . <p> 43 . Hegemony <p> Ever since people first got together to live in cities , there have been groups of citizens with differing cultural or social backgrounds . When one group politically dominates all the others , it is called a " hegemony , " and the term can be applied to any form of government that fits the description . <p> 44 . Heuristic <p> If someone once helped you to work something out for yourself , he or she used a heuristic teaching method . You could call it " hands on " learning , but nobody shows you what to do . They just show you how to figure it out , and you get to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holistic <p> The simplest definition for this would be to say that holism considers various factors that influence each other , and not just one factor , influence or symptom in isolation . The term is most commonly used in philosophy and medicine , but it is getting quite commercialized , and is sometimes used elsewhere too . <p> 46 . Homonym <p> When two words are spelled the same , are pronounced the same , but have different meanings , they are homonyms . For instance , " The man standing beside the pole is a Pole . " <p> 47 . Hubris <p> In Greek mythology , hubris was a state in which mankind defied the gods or thought itself better than the gods . Dreadful consequences predictably followed . Today , it means excessive pride or confidence that could lead to terrible consequences . <p> 48 . Incisive <p> Have you ever tried to explain how you feel about something at length only for your listener to sum it all up in a sentence or two ? That 's incisive thinking . It gets to the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incognito <p> Are you mysterious ? Then you may like being incognito using another identity or concealing your own identity in some other way . <p> 50 . Inculcate <p> This means teaching someone a principle or habit in such a way that the lesson is fully ingrained and adopted . <p> 51 . Interpolate <p> Interpolating something means inserting it between fixed points . The word is often used to indicate that something has been added to a book or text . Perhaps there are images , or perhaps a third party has added information . It can also be an interruption when someone is talking . <p> 52 . Irony <p> Too easy ? Nevertheless , this word is often incorrectly used . Irony means saying the opposite of what you mean for effect . Sometimes , events can be ironic for the same reason : they seem to contradict each other . Many people confuse it with sarcasm . <p> 53 . Juxtaposition <p> When two contrasting situations or thoughts are compared for effect , we have a juxtaposition . Its a useful technique in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone presents you with a na+ve point of view , seems to be oversimplifying , or has only superficial knowledge , you can use this word , both to describe their efforts , and to baffle them . <p> 55 . Lionize <p> When you treat someone as if they were a celebrity , then you are lionizing them . Sometimes , we do this out of genuine respect for what they do , but sometimes , people do it to gain favor . <p> 56 . Lucubration <p> The word " lucubration " could be used to indicate something that has been given a lot of study and deep thought , but its also a rather rude way of describing a piece of writing that seems terribly pedantic and overelaborate . <p> 57 . Malapropism <p> The word " malapropism " was coined thanks to a 1755 play by Richard Sheridan . Mrs. Malaprop would often replace words with similar sounding ones with amusing results . If you talk about having " danced the flamingo " you are guilty of a malapropism . <p> 58 . Magnanimous <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less powerful positon , you can call him or her " magnanimous . " Its a form of generosity that is n't really necessary , but that shows kindness . <p> 59 . Mnemonic <p> When you use a combination of letters , a rhyme , or a set of associated things to remember a list of names or facts , you are using mnemonics . <p> 60 . Motif <p> A motif could be something as simple as a design on a Tee shirt , or it can be a theme in writing or music . A leitmotif is a " leading motif " that is one of several motifs , but is dominant . In music , it could be a theme tune associated with a particular character . <p> 61 . Moiety <p> In anthropology , this term relates to the groups into which people are divided during important rituals , but it has also come to mean a share , particularly a lesser one . <p> 62 . Nihilism <p> " Nothing matters , everything is trivial , even existence is questionable and could be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any importance . " If this depressing philosophy appeals to you , you are a nihilist . <p> 63 . Nomenclature <p> A nomenclature is a system designed for naming things . It could be a set of terminology , a term , or it could refer to a scientific naming system such as that used to identify all living things with two Latin names . <p> 64 . Nemesis <p> You do n't  want to meet this person or circumstance . It is an " inescapable agent " that leads to your downfall . <p> 65 . Obfuscate <p> Scenario : you have just been to class . Your teacher has explained something at length in terms that have left you totally confused . Scenario two : you ask a friend why they did something you do n't  quite approve of , and they give you a long story that leaves you feeling baffled . Words can be used to clarify , or they can be used to obfuscate facts . <p> 66 . Obsequious <p> People are bowing and scraping and offering every possible tribute to someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the servile degree of attention they are giving . <p> 67 . Oligarchy <p> A small group of people with very similar interests have absolute control over the destiny of a country or an institution . Does that sound scary ? Now you know what to call it ! <p> 68 . Onomatopoeia <p> " Bang ! Crash ! Zoink . Kerflabaflabaflaba ! " Words that are meant to imitate sounds are examples of onomatopoeia . <p> 69 . Ontology <p> What is the metaphysical nature of being ? Do you have an opinion ? Thats ontology ! Do n't  even ask me about mine <p> 70 . Orthography <p> How are words spelled ? Thats orthography right there ! <p> 71 . Oxymoron <p> I 'm sure you know a few phrases that are contradictions in terms . Some say that " military intelligence " is one of them . Which oxymoron is your favorite ? <p> 72 . Paradigm <p> If you go into business , you will hear this word rather a lot . It means a model that governs the way things are done , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or that there is a new one . <p> 73 . Paucity <p> When there is too little of anything , you are suffering a paucity of it . Its most often used in relation to facts , but it works just as well and even more uncomfortably with funds . <p> 74 . Pecuniary <p> How remarkable that this word should follow my last incisive remark ! Pecuniary considerations are about money . Please do not use them as the sole basis for choosing a career . You will be unhappy , but will have achieved pecuniary gain . <p> 75 . Pedantic <p> Sometimes , its good to be fussy or finicky about the way you present information , but if you go too far with it , people will call you " pedantic . " <p> 76 . Pedagogy <p> Pedagogy is teaching , and a pedagogue is a teacher , but this old-fashioned word is often used negatively to describe someone who teaches rather boringly . <p> 77 . Pejorative <p> If you 're inclined to disapprove or disparage something , you are being pejorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Phonemes are letters that distinguish very similar words from one another . For instance , " pad , pat , bad and bat " are distinguished from each other by phonemes . <p> 79 . Plagiarism <p> As a student , you need to understand plagiarism and know how to avoid it . If you were to copy whole passages from someone elses work , that 's plagiarism . Of course , plagiarism is something to be avoided whenever you are supposed to be producing original work . <p> 80 . Proletariat <p> If you are an average working class person , you are a member of the proletariat . The word was extensively used in Marxist philosophy , but now its fair game for anyone to use . <p> 81 . Prolix <p> When someone calls your written work " prolix , " you should not congratulate yourself . It means you have presented it in an overly complicated , wordy , or rambling fashion . Its also a great scrabble word . Just imagine the score if you hit " triple word score " with it ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally timid may be deserving of a suitably disparaging adjective . This is it . <p> 80 . Quotidian <p> You could use this word to describe something that is mundane or that happens every day . If you 're looking for a synonym , try " everyday " for size . In medicine , it is used to describe a particularly nasty form of malaria . <p> 81 . Reify <p> Never let it be said that we only looked at long words . This one means turning something abstract into something more real and easier to understand . <p> 82 . Rubric <p> There are three meanings for this word . It could be a statement of purpose or function , a simple heading at the top of a document , or a note in a liturgical book indicating how a ceremony should be performed . <p> 83 .

Of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 . Scurrilous <p> Being scurrilous could mean everything from being humorously insulting to being downright libelous and spreading nasty rumors . <p> 85 . Sesquipedalian <p> What could be better than a really long word to describe the use of long words ? I have to admit , this is one of my favorites , simply because it seems so appropriate , and rather funny . <p> 86 . Soliloquy <p> Nowadays , if you were to talk to yourself about what your thoughts and feelings , people would think you had gone mad . Nevertheless , the soliloquy has been widely used in drama to give audiences an insight into the characters thoughts . <p> 87 . Tautology <p> There are two ways to use this word . A tautology could be an unnecessary repetition repeating the same idea using different words . It could also be used to describe logic that is undeniably correct and proves a truth . <p> 88 .

Ubiquitous <p> Anything that is everywhere to be found or seems to be so is " ubiquitous . " " Text speak is becoming so ubiquitous that it may soon be accepted in business letters . " <p> 90 . Umami <p> Your tongue can identify a number of flavors . Umami is a meaty flavor that is not sweet , sour , or salty . <p> 91 . Vernacular <p> The language you speak at home , or the one spoken by a specific group of people in a country or region is its vernacular language . It also refers to architecture that focuses on what is functional . <p> 92 . Verisimilitude <p> Is something real ? Is it true ? Are you unsure ? Then you are doubting its verisimilitude . This word is handy because it combines the concepts of truth and reality . <p> 93 . Vitriolic <p> When people are vitriolic , I either find it very funny ( which they do n't  intend ) or annoying . Vitriolic speech or writing is bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know someone who always has advice for you no matter how little knowledge he or she has ? Now you have the right word to describe this person ! <p> 95 . Unctuous <p> Its usually very nice when people admire you , but sometimes you get the feeling that a person is being oily or insincere , and just wants to get into your good books . When this happens , you have just been the object of unctuous behavior . <p> 96 . Uxorious <p> When a man is overly submissive towards his wife , he can be described as " uxorious . " Of course , she might just say that 's just how it should be ! <p> 97 . Vacuity <p> " I admire your vacuity , " he said . " Why , thank you , " she replied , proving the point . Vacuity is empty-headedness and a lack of intelligence . <p> 98 . Xeric <p> Generally , when we see the prefix " Xero " or " Xer " we can associate the word that it introduces with something very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even prefers very dry conditions , and a xerophyte , is a plant that tolerates extremely dry environments . <p> 99 . Zymurgy <p> This is a very helpful scrabble word , but what does it mean ? Zymurgy is the art of brewing , wine-making or distilling . <p> 100 . Zephyr <p> A zephyr is a pleasant , light breeze that youd welcome on a hot summer day . " A passing zephyr rustled through the treetops . " Ah ! Poetic ! <p> A subordinating conjunction ( also called subordinate conjunction ) links two particular parts of a sentence : a dependent and an independent clause . When a sentence has these two elements , its classified as complex . Here is an example of a dependent clause . <p> If you dare to hit me , <p> Hey , do n't  you want to know what 's going to happen next ? Yes , because the idea is incomplete . It depends on the next clause to finish it , I will call Mommy for help ! <p> This is the independent clause that finishes the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own as a sentence ; that 's why its independent . You can also see that " if " begins the dependent clause . That 's the subordinating conjunction . It can either come at the start or the end of the dependent clause . When its first , you always have a comma after the clause . <p> Before you begin to feel bad about not knowing when to use " its " as opposed to " its , " I have a confession to make . There was a time long , long ago , in a galaxy very like this one , when I did n't  know the difference either ! <p> In my defense , it is really easy to get confused . Generally speaking , you would use an apostrophe for omitted letters ( e.g. when you say " what 's " instead of " what is " ) as well as for possessives ( " Johns " meaning that something belongs to John ) . To make it even more confusing , you could say " Johns in the backyard , " and that would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and the contraction get the apostrophe . <p> But there is a special rule that applies to the word " it . " Sometimes , youd use the apostrophe and that would be correct , and other times , it would be derisively referred to as a " grocers apostrophe . " <h> What 's a Grocers Apostrophe ? <p> A grocers apostrophe is an apostrophe that is used in the wrong place . Have you ever seen signage bearing the information " Bananas on special today ? " That 's a genuine grocers apostrophe in action . As you probably know , the plural of " banana " is " bananas . " No apostrophe is needed . You could say " The bananas skin was yellow , " because you are now using the possessive form . The skin belonging to the banana was yellow . <p> Just as you may feel a little superior when you see that " bananas " are on special , so teachers and other nit-picky people like bosses and well me would smirk when they see an " its " instead of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one to use in what circumstances . Its actually quite logical . If you remember one important fact , you 'll never get it wrong again . <h> Only Use the Apostrophe for the Contraction <p> You only use the apostrophe for the contraction of " it is " and sometimes , " it has . " Can you remember this ? Then you 're good to go already . In contractions , letters are omitted , and we indicate the missing letter with an apostrophe . Examples of contractions include : <p> Its It is <p> What 's What is <p> Do n't  Do not <p> Wont Will not <p> Shell She will <p> And so on , and so on . The apostrophe is used to show the word is a contraction , and in the case of the word " it , " its the only time you 'll use an apostrophe . <h> Never Use the Apostrophe For " Belonging to " It <p> Usually , youd use the apostrophe for possessives too , but not in this case . <p> Johns scarf got tangled in Marys . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy is under the sofa . <p> The business logo is very smart . <p> Use the word " it " , however , and the " belonging to " form has no apostrophe . <p> The cat played with its toy . <p> Its paint is peeling . <p> Its logo is unimaginative . <h> How Can You Know for Sure When to Use the Apostrophe ? <p> Its easy ! If you can extend " its " into " it is " or " it has , " then the apostrophe is completely correct . Try it with the possessive , and it obviously wont work . Another way to remember is to think about the words " his " or " hers . " Neither of these words has an apostrophe either . " Its " is simply the form of " his " or " hers " you would use when talking about something that 's not a person . <p> That 's because the words " its , " " his " and " hers " are not actually nouns . They are pronouns . That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronoun , but it does help a little since pronouns with apostrophes showing possession are relatively rare . Using them with possessive pronouns ( and " its " is a possessive pronoun , just like " his , " " hers , " " yours , " or " theirs " ) would be redundant because the very nature of the word shows possession . <p> Now you have the more complicated explanation , too . But do n't  worry about it too much . Simply remember when you refer to something belonging to an " it , " no apostrophe is used . Do that , and you 'll never make the common writing mistake of adding an apostrophe to " it " when its unnecessary . 
@@12747198 @1347198/ <h> How Long Does It Take to Write a Book ? <p> How long is a piece of string ? How tall is a tree ? As we so often find , there is no single answer to certain questions , and the question of how long it takes to write a book is one of these . There are so many variables that come into play it would be difficult to enumerate them all , but generally speaking , the volume of text , the complexity of the subject matter and the amount of time a writer can actually devote to his or her writing are among the factors that would influence the answer . For those looking for the most rudimentary of guidelines , it takes a year to write a book . Now that has been written , its also important to point out that the year-to-book timeline does n't  really apply to anything more than a framework to get some writers started . <h> Some of the quickest books to write <p> E-books : The fastest Ive ever written an e-book from beginning to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would have made it a bit short if the book were to be printed for an adult reading audience ; but for an e-book , it was relatively substantial . The topic required quite a lot of research , so if I 'd picked a subject that was a little less factual than " How to train for a marathon , " I estimate I could have finished even faster . <p> Heavily illustrated books : Kids books for a very young reading audience and coffee table books that consist mainly of images can be even quicker to write . I 've knocked off a kids story in less than an hour , and just captioning images does n't  take long when eye-candy is the principal selling point of a book . That does n't  mean the book will be ready in that amount of time . Since these books are n't  primarily about writing , the writing is the easiest and quickest part of the process . The other aspects ( photography , illustrations ) will take much longer . <p> Recipe books : It does n't  take long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time spent in the kitchen testing your recipes and taking photographs of your mouth-watering results into account , it can turn into quite a lengthy project . But the actual writing ? It does n't  take long at all . <h> What about your magnum opus ? <p> I 'd love to be able to tell you how many words youd write a day if you worked on your literary masterpiece all day every day , but everyone has their own pace , and some days are better than others . In general , I manage a word count of about 4,000 words on a writing a day provided I have direction and know what comes next . I edit on the following day , and that takes anything from half the day to the whole day , depending on my form when I drafted the original text , my mood , and whether I 'm feeling self-confident on the day . That brings down the final number to about 2,000 words a day when averaging it out . <p> If you 're really writing something that means a lot to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine decided she needed to change the focus of her autobiographical work when she was already halfway through writing it . I think it was the right decision , but it meant she had to go back and revise absolutely everything shed already written . <p> Another writing buddy faced repeated rejections from publishers when she submitted her science fiction story . One publisher was kind enough to tell her what he thought needed changing , and she 's been reworking the whole thing by fits and starts ever since . <p> Even non-fiction works can take ages to compile . Edward Gibbons " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire " took 20 years to complete , but it is still considered to be the definitive work on Roman history . Meanwhile , " The Cantos " by Ezra Pound took a massive 52 years to write , and he would probably still be writing it if he were still alive . The unfinished book was published after his death in 1969 . <p> Then again , Mickey Spillane is said to have written his first novel in just 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books every year . Could detective fiction be one of the easiest genres to tackle ? However , Jack Kerouac takes the cake with " On the Road " a book that he is said to have completed over a single weekend . Mind you , I 've read it , or tried to , and its difficult to digest . <h> Anything from a week to a lifetime <p> here 's the bottom line : depending on a whole range of factors , writing a book could take you as little as a week or as long as a lifetime . If you 're serious about writing a book and getting it published before you depart from this mortal coil , I 'd advise you to get started now . Create a framework to guide you through the chapters you have to write , and set mini-deadlines for yourself so that you 're forced to keep working at it . If you receive rejection letters , see if you can distil any valuable information from them . Then go back to your book and see if you can accommodate the ideas you 've been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner you can get it back to the kind publisher who actually took the trouble of reading your proof and commenting on it , the greater your chance of getting it published . <h> 8 comments <p> I could say I am a bookworm . I can read a whole book in a day , but I got to thinking that what I read in one day takes a year or more for someone to write . It takes a lot less time to consume the writing than it does to create the writing . I think I should appreciate the work the writers must do more . <p> I want to write a book , but I 'm not sure I want to spend all the time it would take to write it . I 'm afraid that I will spend a year and then nobody will want to read it . If that happens , I will have wasted a year of my life . How do you write a book when you want to , but you do n't  think it will be good enough for people to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take and if anyone will read it , then you really do n't  want to write a book . You just like the image of you writing a book . If you really wanted to write a book , these things would n't even be a consideration in your thoughts . <p> I think it depends on each person . Some people are able to write books quickly while others it will take a lot of time . There is not a specific time for everyone as each book is different . I think each person should set a realistic goal as to when they want to be done and shoot for that goal . <p> Its pretty conceited of you to assume that you are the standard when it comes to writing books . No two people are the same , so the amount of time it takes to write a book for each person will be different . Your statement is like me saying anybody who does n't  know how to scuba dive is stupid just because I happen to enjoy scuba diving . It does n't  make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else . <p> The problem is that so many people know this now and they create " click bait " titles .

@@12747199 @1347199/ <h> Tag : hangman <p> If you 're looking to kill a little time using nothing but a pen and paper to entertain yourself and a friend , you have several options . One is the tried and true word game " Hangman . " In the unlikely event that you did n't  learn this game years ago , here 's how its played . <p> One player chooses a word and draws a series of dashes for each letter in the word . The other player tries to guess which letters are used in the word , and the first player fills them in with each correct guess . If a guess is wrong , the iconic image of the stick man hanging from a gallows begins to appear stroke by stroke . Rules on how the hanged man is drawn vary , but this generally allows for a maximum of 10 wrong guesses . <p> Do you want to defeat your friends at Hangman ? Choosing words that are difficult to guess gives you the edge . According to veteran players , the ones listed below are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four letters , but its as tough as nails to guess . The reason why this one is so hard is that it includes two of the letters least used in the English language , namely J and Z. Be hated and feared by choosing this tough nut . <h> Buzz <p> This word makes use of the same strategy , and if your friends start to see a pattern , theyll begin by choosing a Z ending just to see if you 're still up to your tricks . Choose a few easy words before you use this one ! <h> Jazzed <p> By now , your friend is ready to throw their pencil at you and march off in a huff . Remind them that its just a game , while you secretly smirk at your own sneakiness in finding out which words are trickiest because you love to win at absolutely everything . By the way , " jazzing " is also a good choice as is " buzzing " and " buzzes . " <h> Words with Double Zees <p> Use your double zee words sparingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " dizzy " to your list , choosing as many permutations as your evil little mind can dream up . But you need more than just zees to make you a winner . <h> Hajj <p> As hangman word choices go , this one is absolutely brutal . Its success lies in the double J ending and the fact that unless your hangman partner is savvy about Muslim culture , he or she probably would n't know how to spell it . Unfortunately , there are n't  any other words with a double J ending , so that 's as far as you can go with this one . <h> Words with a Double F <p> " Faff , " " duff , " " buff , " and " puff " are words that will expand your strategy of choosing rarely-used and seldom-guessed letters . Once again , feel free to add plurals , put verbs in the past tense , and so on . <h> Words Containing the Letter X <p> Do you sigh every time you pick the letter X when playing Scrabble ? Turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " vex , " and " fox . " Other words with X in them such as " six " may be too easy because they 're frequently used words , so stick with the more obscure choices . <h> Obscure Words with Unusual Letters <p> Put the double whammy on your opponents with unusual words that also contain less common letters of the alphabet . Below are a few examples you can place into your Hangman arsenal : <p> Quetzalcoatl <p> Sequoia <p> Asexual <p> Livid <p> Chthonic <p> Zwieback <p> Phylum <h> Words People Struggle to Spell <p> If you 'd like a whole arsenal of nasty hangman words to make your friends hate you , look no further than words people often misspell . Even if they get several letters right , they may not get the correct answer . <h> Words with Y as a Semi-Vowel <p> Most people go into a Hangman game assuming there will be a vowel in the word you 've chosen . You can use this assumption to your advantage by choosing words that use the letter Y in place of a vowel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will likely frustrate your opponent to no end . You can also try pushing your luck with words like " hmm , " but it really is taking a bit of a chance , and you may just be accused of cheating . <h> Words Ending in the Letter Q <p> Choosing words that contain the letter Q will make guessing the word more difficult , but if you really want to take it up a level , pick a word that ends in the letter Q. Warning : if you decide to do this , the person you play with will likely start throwing random objects at you . <h> Hangman <p> I 've left the most annoying choice for last , and if you use this one , you had better have on your running shoes . By now , your friend is already questioning whether he or she wants to remain your friend . This is a good one to use when you 're ready to finish the game since nobody will want to play with you after you use this word . <p> For those wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be all hard work and no play . Word games get our mental juices going as we strive to solve puzzles , beat our neighbors and come up with letter combinations that magically make sense when arranged in the right way . <p> If you were to search this title on the internet , youd mostly find reference to word gaming apps , and many of them are really quite good , but on the whole , its still the classics that are the most fun . That 's not to say you should avoid the apps . Many are based on the classics , and the ones that set time limits for you to make your move or expect you to find as many words as possible in a given time provide an extra challenge and a shot of adrenalin . Still , its still worthwhile to play some of the classic games from time to time since they can be pure word joy . <h> Scrabble <p> This game will always be a classic choice and trying to hit those double or triple word scores adds an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on a dictionary to use as your source . Scrabble specific dictionaries often allow a lot of words that are n't  words at all at least not in the everyday sense . I prefer to use my trusty dictionary set as a reference ; if its not there , you cant use it . Of course , that 's just me . Many people are happy to immerse themselves in scrabble dictionaries to learn sneaky new two and three letter words , or a variety of words that begin with the letter Q. <h> Crosswords <p> If you do n't  have a handy friend to compete against , a solitary word game works best . Crosswords range from the deeply cryptic to the relatively simple , but they 're always challenging . Be sure to use a pencil with an eraser on the back , because there are times when more than one word fits the clue . <h> Hangman <p> To play this game the traditional way with pen and paper , you need a real live opponent . There are several app versions , so you can also load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commute or when waiting for appointments . There are a number of variations on the theme , but they all involve guessing a word from clues . Every wrong guess sees a drawing of hanged man progressing further so you have a limited amount of guesses . <h> Pictionary <p> This game is best played when you have at least three other people joining in . Its fun , there 's often hilarity , and you get to practice your language skills and your drawing skills simultaneously . Its been around since 1985 , and its still going strong . <h> Spill and Spell <p> Spill out the letters and see how many words you can make with them . Because you multiply the number of letters used in your word to calculate your points , the longer your word is , the better . A 5 letter word would make you 25 points , but a 6 letter word scores 36 . <h> Word Search <p> Puzzle books , newspapers , and magazines often offer word search games . Once again , there are plenty of word search puzzles available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , it can be quite tricky ! On the whole , though , its an easy game that tests your powers of observation and your reading skills . <h> Target <p> Target puzzles are among my favorites even though they often have me beaten after hours of thought . You really have to think out of the box , and finding all the words hidden in the 9 letters the puzzle offers is truly challenging . Youre given 9 letters , one of which has to be included in every word you make . There 's usually just one 9-letter word hidden in your letter set but there may be several 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 letter words . How many can you find ? <h> Typing Games <p> Typing games help you to improve your typing speed , accuracy , and spelling .

Remember you are n't  supposed to look at the keyboard . <h> Balderdash <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke laughter . At the same time , you 'll learn some pretty obscure words while you try to distinguish fake definitions from real ones . Learning really can be fun . <h> Words with Friends <p> There has to be at least one high-tech word game in the bunch , and Words with Friends is a hugely popular option with many celebrities giving it the thumbs up .

@@12747201 @1347201/ <h> Tag : book titles <p> Titling a book or an article is a tricky thing . There are many considerations . You want it to be catchy but meaningful . You do n't  want the same title that a thousand others have already used . You want it to convey what the work is about without giving away the ending . You do n't  want it to be so long that people give up reading it , nor so short that people have no idea what they 're getting . Many writers find choosing a title to be more difficult and frustrating than revisions . While I cant make it any easier for you to choose your ideal title , I can give you some things to consider during the process . <h> Do n't  over-promise <p> Words like " Epic , " " Fantastic , " " Revolutionary , " " Breakthrough , " and " Incredible " are overused and they promise something that your work likely ca n't deliver . You may have a great story , but its doubtful that its truly epic in scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how much you may think so . Readers do n't  like to be lied to , so err on the side of under-promising with your title and then delivering a great piece that exceeds their expectations . Let the critics and reviewers label your book as " Epic " or " Revolutionary " if its deserving of that honor . <h> Try to keep it short <p> Long titles create a host of issues for readers and catalogers . When readers peruse a crowded shelf , long titles often get overlooked . For a long title to fit on a book jacket , the font often has to be smaller and hard to read . A title with a short word count , though , can be printed much larger and is easier to see . Long titles may be truncated when viewed online or in databases and they 're hard to turn into good urls . They 're hard to fit on business cards . Long titles are also hard to recommend to friends . " Hey , did you read , Fat Loss , " is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get in Shape , Lose Weight , and Lose Fat Through Exercise and Calorie Counting . " <h> But do n't  fear a long title <p> Short may be best , but some books just require a long title . If you choose to go long , make sure you have a good reason for doing so and that you 're not just being lazy or uncreative . <h> Research your choices <p> Before you fall in love with a title , check to see how many other books carry the same title . Its not a deal breaker if other books share your title ( titles ca n't be copyrighted , after all ) , but it becomes more problematic if the book also is in your genre . A how-to book called , " Floored ! " which is about flooring will not likely be confused with a novel called , " Floored ! " that 's about a character that receives a big surprise . But you might have a problem if there are two novels titled , " Floored ! " and they are both literary fiction . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The short , catchy part of the title can be used to lure readers in while the longer subtitle can clarify what the book is actually about .

" Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone . " " Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince .

The book is a rambling mess and the title is , too . If you 're very clear on what you 're writing about , the information you 're trying to convey , or the story you 're trying to tell , its much easier to create a title . <h> Wait until you 're finished <p> A corollary to the above is to wait to choose the title until you 're finished writing the book .

@@12747202 @1347202/ <h> Writers Block is a Myth <p> I used to believe in writers block . On the days when I would sit at the computer or page and feel like I had nothing to say , I 'd say , " Oh , I have writers block , " and then go off and do something else . Having this " disease " of writers block gave me an excuse to avoid the hard work of writing . It was a crutch , something I could point to when someone asked how the writing was going . " Oh , I have writers block , " I could say dramatically and sound like some sort of tortured artist who had much to say and could write great works , if only I werent burdened with this terrible disease . <p> And then I wised up to what writers block really is . Its a myth , created by writers who know they should be writing but who simply do n't  want to put in the work . Theyd rather walk the dog , watch a movie , or play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want to write because its hard work or because they simply are n't  that dedicated to the occupation . Its easier and more face saving to invent this mythical condition that afflicts only the gifted and artistic . <p> In what other field do you hear of some kind of block ? Outside of other artistic pursuits like painting or sculpting , you do n't  . You never hear about a brain surgeon who stands in front of an open skull and says , " I cant operate today because I have surgeons block . " You do n't  hear about a mechanic who stands in front of an open hood and says , " You know , I have mechanics block and cant do this right now . " You never see the great athlete who gets to the Olympics and says , " I cant run today because I have runners block . " Nope . In almost every other occupation and pursuit people just get on with the work . They do what they have to do because it is their job , or because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of writing as your job ( even if its a hobby ) , you 'll never have writers block . You will always find something to write . If one project is n't firing for you , you start another one or work on another existing project . If you are having trouble getting into the groove , you do some free writing until you get there . Or , you write something even if its horrible just to get the words flowing , knowing that everything can be fixed and that your job is to move this project forward . If you ca n't think of your writing as a job to be done no matter how your delicate artistic temperament is feeling that day , then you need to find another occupation . <p> Writers block is defined as , " The condition of being unable to think of what to write or how to proceed with writing . " This should never be a problem for a writer . You should always be able to write something . Maybe its not perfect ( or even good ) and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But each time you sit down to write , you should be able to think of something to write , or some way to proceed . If you do n't  , its not because you have some terrible disease called writers block . Its because you have one of the following afflictions : <p> Laziness <p> You do n't  want to work this hard <p> You do n't  want it ( success , publication , money , etc. ) enough <p> You do n't  like writing all that much and should probably find another hobby or occupation <p> Something else is simply more important to you <p> The project you 're working on is n't for you ( too difficult , not your specialty , its irredeemably bad , etc. ) and its time to ditch it and start something else . <p> Lack of confidence in your ability <p> Fear <p> Lack of ability <p> Whatever ails you can be solved . You can dump a bad project . You can deal with your fear . You can do the work to become a better writer . You can decide writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead . You do n't  have a disease , you have a problem that needs to be solved . If you solve the problem and approach writing as a professional , you 'll never say , " I have writers block " again . <p> The day I began to see writing as my job , even if I was n't getting paid for it just yet , the writers block disappeared . I knew I had to work at writing , just like I would have to work at any other occupation . There is no exemption because I 'm in an " artistic " field . There 's no excuse for not doing the work , short of illness or some sort of catastrophe . Just like any employer would expect me to get the work done no matter what , I now expect the same for myself . Now that I 've adopted that attitude , I can always find something to write or some project to work on . <p> Writers block is for divas who believe that writing is some mystical gift governed by a muse who either appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get someone out of the hard work of becoming a better writer . Its not for professionals who treat writing as a job to be done . <h> 9 comments <p> As a professional writer , I have to agree and disagree with this article . <p> First of all , writers block is not a myth . There are times when you 're simply stumped on where to go or how to describe something , and the best course of action may be to put your project down , do something else for a while , and let the answer come to you in its own time . It can happen to anyone , and its not always your fault . <p> Drafting a detailed , complete outline before actually writing your book can reduce that problem , and remaining dedicated is certainly important , but even that I find sometimes wo n't totally eliminate the problem . Any detailed creative work has the potential to hit a snag , because no one can produce a constant stream of creativity , and solving abstract problems often just takes time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their won equivalent of writers block . <p> The examples you referred to of professions that do n't  get an equivalent of writers block are inapplicable , in my opinion . Surgery and auto repair are technical fields , not creative fields , and solutions lie in already knowing how to fix any problems that present themselves , a luxury that writers and artists do n't  have . However , even doctors and mechanics need to figure things out , and they can easily be baffled for a time by unique difficulties . <p> Runners perform with their bodies , not their minds , so they really cant get an equivalent of writers block . They can have a performance off-day if their body is ailed or something , but that 's different . Athletes in competitive team sports can have days when their head is n't in the game , and that can be construed as a form of writers block . <p> However , you 're absolutely correct in saying that writers block can be ( and often is ) artificially induced . I 've caught myself falling under several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other writers I know . I 've had many days where there are about a dozen other things I 'd rather do , eliminating my focus and rendering me unable to continue my project . Other days , as you noted , I feel just plain lazy , and its very difficult to progress with a disengaged mind . <p> Anyway , there 's my two or three cents . A good and useful article overall , but I would n't be so quick to dismiss writers block or to blame yourself for drawing a blank . My advice would be to ensure that you 're not creating the block , and if you 're not , just put down the project and let your mind rest . The answers will always come to the good writers , but sometimes it just takes time . <p> I strongly disagree with your assertion and I feel I have a personal experience of what is commonly called " writers block " . I believe " writers block " is poorly named because surely those suffering it can surely write a shopping list or their name . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inadequacy . Let me explain . I am a very creative person and in my teens wrote considerably . My " block " began when a creative writing teacher and a mythology teacher in my HIgh school both told my parents at a teachers conference that I was writing at a professional level and could make my living at it in spite of my relatively young age . When my parents , who were used to negative parent/teacher conferences , proudly informed me ( not only was I a " reformed " dyslexic , lucky enough to have gotten fantastic therapy , I was , by that time a bit of a neer do well and quite taken with the " burn out " culture that was popular at the time ) , nothing I wrote seemed good enough . I thought that I needed to create award winning , socially significant oeuvres that would change the world.Any socially or personal writing that I attempted seemed too personally revealing and my fiction seemed banal . I am now 51 and am looking to re-kindle the creativity that has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing is better than not writing . Though I have definite ideas of what the world needs to hear , I am still too worried what others might think of me . I 've often heard people make judgments on the imagination of others that I worry if I share some of my stranger thoughts that people I love and respect would think my characters or projections were an extension of my desires and an indication of a maladjustment . So I do believe in the idea of writers block , just not the term . <p> Good post Kevin . All I can say to you is not give a crap what your friends/family thinks of your work , you 're free to express your creativity in whichever way to wish , and to tell yourself that youre being watched , and your works will be judged by your peers will only serve to prevent the creation of anything to begin with . Put these people , these ideas out of your mind , just write . Write for yourself , write for the sake of writing , write to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article rests on a general misunderstanding of what people think writers block is . When people say they have writers block , I do n't  think they think they have absolutely nothing to write . They just do n't  know how to advance a story or article in the direction they want because they do n't  know what direction they want to go down . <p> I agree that some times its just an excuse to do no writing at all but creativity is n't always at a high . The same way a mathematician might not be able to solve a problem but come back later and find a different approach to it . <p> I do n't  think writers block is a myth but it can be intertwinned with the fear of not producing your best every time to you do something . <p> Creativity can be improved just like any other skill in my opinion and you 'll have stumbling blocks but it helps to just keep trying . <p> I do n't  have and have never had a broken bone , but that does not mean one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life when I was completely convinced I 'd broken my hand , but it turned out I had n't  . My nephew , on the other hand , did break his hand about a week ago . Broken bones exist . I have been blessed to have never been the recipient of such , but they really do happen . <p> When writers who have been fortunate enough to never really been crippled by writers block blithely singsong on the internet that there 's no such thing , I often wonder how many other things they assume do n't  exist just because it has n't  happened to them . <p> Writers block is the stopping of creative thinking in a certain direction because of indecision . The inability to figure out how to proceed with a " Single project . " Just because one has writers block does n't  mean they could n't write something different or some crappy one shot , their hands are n't  gone . That seems to be a misconception on your part , of what writers block really is . <p> Personally ? I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with being busy . Bad mixture . Regardless , as a critic I do know it exists , Ive seen it . Ive been there helping hundreds of writers figure out what to do next . <p> Its not a disease or some excuse as you put it , its a problem that needs work to get through . It can effect anyone working on anything creative . People can be burnt out and a new perspective is great . Honestly I suggest that anyone suffering from writers block simply talk to a close friend about the idea and ask for advice on how to move forward . Maybe brain storm . <p> Unwillingness to continue and being stumped are different things , something your article trys to deny . <p> What you 're approaching here is n't the absence of writers block in existence , but people who use it as an excuse to be unwilling . <p> You 're beef is with laziness , simple as that . You may be clear headed all the time but most people are n't  , most people simply do n't  have the imagination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things in your article though . For instance , a doctor does n't  quit saving people because he s stumped . He finds something to study on the problem or procedure so he knows how to act accordingly , maybe he asks a friend . <p> Its the same with writing . <p> My personal cure for " writers block " ? <p> Create an " idea folder " and get some themed music . Play the music , sit back and let your imagination run with it . Write down whatever you imagine , no matter how weird . <p> Eventually you 'll have a folder filled to the brim with ideas to call upon and mold to your purpose when you find yourself confused or indecisive . <p> Writers Block is so way real ! Normally it happens when your stressed over something ( what you 're writing , something that happened before you started writing , ect . ) That 's why you walk away from the project for a little while <p> Whether or not it exists , my opinion is , " Always have more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you get hung-up on something start work on other projects so you never stop being productive . If you need a break , try to read a good ( or horrible ) book , but do try to avoid TV . " <p> I 'm a bit of a hypocrite about the TV thing , but typically I have about ten projects going all the time ( not a good idea for people who do n't  keep good notes ) .

Whether you write fiction , non-fiction or are a freelance writer , a website gives readers and clients a way to find you , interact with your work , and hire you for jobs .

Too many posts about your dog or your garden ( unless you write about dogs or gardening ) will turn people off who came to learn about your work . <h> Information about upcoming projects <p> If you have books in the pipeline , give your readers a heads up about what 's coming .

I 've played it since the first iteration and have spent an embarrassing amount of money and time on the game . It used to be a guilty pleasure until I discovered that I could use it to further my writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Well , sort of . ) <p> The Sims let 's me quickly create characters and let them live through situations ( well , most of the time they live , sometimes they die ) that would take me weeks of outlining to accomplish . I can experiment with various personality traits . I can give them jobs ( they can even be writers ) , let them run their own business , keep them unemployed , or get them fired or promoted at work . They can be criminals or good guys . I can make them rich , or keep them poor . I can make them happy or mad . I can put them in relationships with other Sims ( both hetero or homosexual ) , leave them unattached , or I can make their relationships go bust . They can even have affairs . I can give them pets or kids . Heck , in the latest iteration of the game I can even experiment with zombies , vampires , and witches and even send my Sims into the future or off to college . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> More than once Ive created a character and let them go about their business with very little assistance from me , just to see what theyd do . Ive taken notes and used their actions and reactions in my work . If things get completely out of control , I can just exit the game without saving and go back to a time when things were better . That 's hard to do after you 've spent a hundred pages going down the wrong path in a novel . Even better , I can save a pristine version of my character and use him or her over and over again in new games to create new stories . I can then pick the story I like best and write about it . That 's a lot easier than working through four or five stories on paper . <p> The Sims is a great way to spark my creativity when its at a low ebb . Sure , I still sit down with paper and pencil and sketch out characters and novel ideas . There are some things a computer game can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and it goes beyond just superficial details like looks and jobs . For example , I can create characters that are " made for " another character , or I can create characters that I know are going to antagonize or even hurt other characters . ( These can later become supporting characters in a novel . ) I can reform bad characters , or make good characters go bad . And then I can sit back and see what happens without having to slog through pages and pages only to discover that it was n't such a great idea after all . <p> I 've even taken some of my characters and their stories and posted them to the online Sims community and let other Simmers give their input as to what the character should do next . Its amazing what other people think of and getting their input expands my work even further . I can also take characters that others have created and add them to my game , creating even more mayhem . In a way , its a form of fan fiction that spills over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> Even if you do n't  use it for your " serious " writing , The Sims can be a big help during NaNoWriMo ( National Novel Writing Month ) if you participate . When you get stuck , just boot up the game and play for a while ( but not too long or you 'll waste too much time ) . You 'll quickly have lots of fodder for your story that will push you toward that 50,000-word goal . <p> If The Sims is n't your thing , or if you need more of a fantasy element for your character creation , there are other options . There are plenty of MMORPGs that allow you to create your own characters and situations , or you can try traditional paper and pencil role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder . <p> Okay , so The Sims is never going to qualify for a tax deduction as a " business related expense .

One of the most common emails we get is from users who have lost something that they have written , and they 're hoping we have a copy of it so that its not completely lost . In response to this , we added a function to the word counter that will leave the words you have written in the word counter text area unless you specifically deleted them from the site . <p> To do this , we use a cookie on your computer and is not saved anywhere on the website meaning only you can access the article again . This has helped a number of users regain articles they thought they had lost , but its not perfect . We still get quite a few emails from people who have cleared their writing before leaving the website , and when these people need the article they wrote , there is nothing we can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeling , so we wanted to give users the option of having their writing saved a bit better . Its with this in mind we have created the option to sign into the website through Facebook . <p> For those who sign into the website through Facebook , theyll now have an autosave for what they write . When signed in , a " Revision " drop-down tab will appear at the top right of the word counter tool . This will save anything you have been writing in word counter every minute for 60 revisions ( it will only make a new revision if there is a change to what you have written into the word counter box in the last minute ) . That means if your computer crashes , the window closes , or even if you clear the page , you still can go to the Revision tab and restore anything you have written in the recent past . <p> In order to do this , what you write is saved onto our servers . Since your writing is linked to your Facebook account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . Since the writing is being saved , technically the site admins ( there are two of us ) can see what you have written , but we do n't  do this . We have no interest in what you 're writing and were far too busy on other projects to be looking through that information . Your work is yours and we will never use it or sell it . We have simply implemented this save option so we can decrease the number of emails we get where users have lost their writing . If you absolutely want to make sure nobody can see what you have been writing , then you should n't use the Facebook sign-in option . <p> Its important to note that this tool should not be used to replace saving your writing on your own computer and backups that you usually make . Its an emergency tool to hopefully retrieve an article that would have otherwise accidentally been lost . There is no long-term storage of the article and after every 60 revisions you make , the writing will disappear . This method also is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen where revisions are n't  saved properly , so you should n't rely on this as your only method to save your work . It is , however , another layer that may help you recover your writing if something unexpected should happen . <p> Writers are sometimes their own worst enemies . We complain endlessly about being unable to get published or make money , but yet its often the case that were sabotaging our own success . Sure , sometimes you get rejected because your writing is n't good enough . But often rejections happen because you made a mistake at the submission level and the gatekeeper turned you down before ever reading your work . <p> Remember that editors , agents , and hiring managers are swamped . They get tons of submissions every day . To quickly cull the pile , they look for any obvious reason to discount your submission . That may be something as simple as a misplaced comma or a misspelled name . You do n't  want to go out this way . You want your recipient to at least read your work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject pile before the first sentence is even read . With that in mind , here are some common mistakes that writers make when submitting their work . <h> Grammatical Errors <p> Whenever you submit something , be it a story , letter , resume , article , or full manuscript , make certain that it is error-free . You 're asking someone to trust that you are a competent writer , yet if the first page has the word " Youre " in a situation where the word " Your " should have been used , you 're not coming across as competent . Always look to improve your writing so that there are no mistakes with it . <h> Submitting to the Wrong Person or Place <p> Do n't  submit to houses or agents that do n't  handle your type of work . Do n't  submit to Editor A and Editor B at the same publishing house . Do n't  address Mrs. Smith as Mr. Smith . ( If you 're unclear on gender , a quick phone call to check is fine . ) Do n't  submit to the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure out exactly who should receive your work and send it directly to that person or department . <h> Mass and Blind Submissions <p> Its irritating to get an email addressed to fifty agents or hiring managers . Such submissions often read , " Dear Sir or Madam , " and then proceed to describe , in very generic terms , why this person should accept your work . Its efficient , but the problem is that your recipients do n't  want to be part of a herd . They want to know why you chose them . They want to know who referred you , or to which ad you are responding . They want to know how you learned of them and why they are the best fit for your work . They want you to demonstrate that you 've done some basic research into who they are and what they represent . Mass submissions are impersonal and only demonstrate that you know how to use the multiple recipient functions in your email program . <h> Failure to Follow Convention <p> Yes , convention can stifle creativity . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to demonstrate that you understand the rules of the " club " and that you can follow them . If convention dictates that your submission be double spaced , single spacing can get you disqualified . If a certain format is required , youd better follow it . Breaking convention wont get you accepted , it will get you rejected . <h> Sending Dirty Work <p> No , I do n't  mean pornography . I mean work that 's stained , crumpled , or torn . In this day and age of quick printing and copying , there 's no excuse for sending out anything other than pristine pages . <h> Looking Like a Paranoid Amateur <p> Many writers submit work with copyright symbols on it , or mentioning in the query letter that the submission should not be shared or forwarded for fear of idea theft . Similarly , do n't  be vague about your work because you 're afraid it will be stolen . " I have a great idea , but I cant share it with you until you commit to publication , " is ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or agent is out to steal your work . You 're only coming across as paranoid and no one wants to work with a nutcase . <h> Failure to Follow Directions <p> Send and do only what the recipient asks for . No more , no less .

" well have to go on a journey through time and the English language . Buckle your safety belt ; its going to be an interesting ride . For those looking for a general answer , " couth " is becoming recognized as a real word as it appears in more and more dictionaries , but it is n't universally accepted as a word at this time . <h> Couth in the Beginning <p> Long , long ago , the word " couth " was used to describe a person or group of people who was familiar . The opposite of that word , " uncouth " was used to describe a foreign or unknown person , usually with habits that were unfamiliar to the couth . Now , most of us are n't  comfortable with foreign habits and mores , and the meaning of the word " uncouth " began to morph into a term for those with bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common usage , became archaic , and was forgotten altogether . <h> Uncouth and a Joke <p> By the time people got around to writing full English dictionaries , only one word remained , " uncouth . " Now usually , a word featuring an " un " is attached to another word , and the prefix makes it mean the opposite thing , but " uncouth " was a peculiar anomaly because " couth " was n't an accepted word at all , at least , not in modern parlance . <p> It seems most likely that introducing " couth " as a word describing someone with good manners , initially started out as a joke . " Havent you got no couth ? " someone would ask before dissolving into gales of laughter at their own wit . It could even be that people looking for an impressive-sounding word for " good manners " decided that " couth " was the logical opposite of " uncouth .

The average English speaker from a few hundred years ago probably would n't understand half of what we say , while we would certainly struggle to understand him . That 's because words and word usages keep changing all the time . <p> Not all that long ago , you would n't have found the word " couth " in any dictionary , but today , you 'll find it in quite a few . Some will note it has a " humorous " origin , while others appear to take it perfectly seriously .

Who is right ? <h> So , Is Couth a Real Word ? <p> " Couth " is becoming more accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time . It is by no means the only English word to be formed from a mistaken assumption .

Today , its 100% acceptable as a word , but I think we need to be a bit cautious with our couth . Its still a little bit on the new side of acceptable . <h> Will Couth Become a Real Word ? <p> We do n't  know . It may fall into disuse and join its predecessor form of " couth " in the archives of little known and seldom remembered language , or it might stick , and become a perfectly serious word that is much quicker and easier to type or say than " well-mannered .

You may co-author a novel together , you may need someone with scientific experience you do n't  have when you write your non-fiction book , or you may need to hire an illustrator for your childrens book . Whatever the reason , a collaboration can be a great way to advance both of your careers and result in a great project that neither one of you could complete alone . Or it could be a disaster that makes you question why you ever wanted to write in the first place and drives you to drink . Heavily . To prevent disaster , consider the following before you agree to collaborate with others . <h> Identify why you need/want to collaborate <p> Can you simply not handle the workload alone ? Does your collaborator have information/expertise that you do not ? Do you want to attach this persons name/credibility to your project so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a collaborator is the first step in choosing the best person for the job . Or , you may decide that you really do n't  need a collaborator and decide to skip it altogether . <h> Choose someone you trust <p> This should be obvious . Pick collaborators that you trust . Youll be putting a portion of your writing career in their hands , so choose wisely . A " brand name " collaborator is worthless if they 're going to make your life miserable for the duration of the project or ruin the project altogether . <h> Clearly assign tasks and deadlines <p> The time to argue about who will do what and when it is due is at the beginning of the project , not midway through . Set forth your expectations and writing deadlines before you begin . Make sure that all partners will be able to handle their parts of the work . Adjustments can be made as needed , but at least begin with a solid framework to avoid disagreements and misunderstandings . <h> Make sure you can communicate <p> Your collaborator should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose someone who intimidates you so much that you wo n't speak up , who never returns calls or emails , or who is never available . Successful collaboration requires a lot of communication so you need someone that is available and open . <h> Make sure you fight well <p> At some point , you will fight with your collaborator . Guaranteed . Make sure the person you 're working with is someone that you can fight with productively and move on . You do n't  want to get stuck with a bully or a sulker . Ideally , you want someone who will work with you to find the compromise position . <h> Specify payment arrangements up front <p> Will you split the payment equally ? Will you split the pay based on the number of hours worked , or amount of words written ? Put whatever arrangements you decide on in writing to prevent problems later . <h> Specify credit arrangements up front <p> Will you share equally in the credit for the work ? Will one of you be the main author with the other relegated to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , or will one person be the ghost writer ? Sort these things out before you begin so feelings are n't  hurt later . <h> What happens if one partner decides to walk away or dies ? <p> While unlikely , there may come a point where one of you says , " That 's it . I 've had enough , " and wants out . Worse , one of you could die . What will you do ? Will the project continue with the remaining partner working solo , or will it just be shelved ? Is the remaining partner allowed to choose another partner ? What about any money arrangements that have been made ? Who gets what ? Specify the contingencies in writing . <h> Protect yourself <p> The most important thing when collaborating is to get everything in writing . You hope it never comes to litigation but if it should , you 'll be glad you have the backup . Its not being pushy to insist on contracts , even if your collaborator is your best friend . Its just smart to make sure that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a lot of fun if its handled well and if it contributes to a better work . It can also be a pain in the butt if partners cant get along or if agreements fall apart . Take these steps before you begin your collaborative project to keep things on the fun side . <h> 3 comments <p> You really need to think this through thoroughly . While having a partner can help in a great many ways , it can cause a lot of issues too . This is especially true when there is a disagreement on the vision of the project ( and there will be ) . If you can constructively work through those disagreements , there is a chance for a good partnership . If you cant , you 'll wonder why you ever thought it would be a good idea . <p> I have collaborated with a number of different authors over the years , and I find in most cases its just not worth the effort . It seems to me that most authors have very set opinions and ideas in their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those situations . If you 're a writer and you 're not willing to compromise , you do n't  want to work with a collaborator . Collaboration is a team effort and you 're not going to get 100% of what you have in your mind about the way the project is going to work . What most authors want when it comes to collaboration , in my opinion , is an assistant to help them with the work they do n't  want to do . Just my two cents . <p> I have to agree . I would never collaborate with another person again after two awful experiences that ended up wasting so much of my time . I think writers who successfully collaborate with each other are the exception rather than the rule .

The practice became something that , while I still did n't  look forward to it , I did n't  hate because I could see that it had value . I started to enjoy learning the rules of piano playing .

Because learning to be a better writer follows much the same journey for most of us . When I started writing , it was pretty much the piano all over again . ( Possibly worse because in this case some well-meaning teachers had told me that I was a good writer , fueling my prodigy fantasies even further . ) I churned out poetry that I thought was deep and wonderful .

I still do n't  know all there is to know , and I likely never will . Through practice , I understand the difference between good work and bad . I know that I can not just slap words on the page and expect them to be good . I have to learn the craft and master the rules ( and then play by the rules when seeking work ) .

As before , you can turn it into a question : " Does the flight board at 6:00AM ? " which is just as correct as its future tense relative " Will the flight board at 6:00AM ? " Yes ! Its happening now or maybe it is n't <p> This is the simplest use of the simple present tense . Its happening , or its supposed to be , but is n't , or you want to know if it is happening . " I am available now . " " I am not available now . " " Are you available now ? " Easy peasy , right ? <h> Look for the adverb ! <p> Habits will often be expressed with an adverb such as " sometimes " , " often " , " always " or " never " . You may not use the adverb , but it could be placed if you desired . For example , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " always " or " never " into the example , and it would be correct ( I always write at my desk " or " I never write at my desk " . The same goes for " only " , " ever " , " still " " often " and " just " . <p> If your spouse were to ask : " Do you often stop at the pub on the way back from the gym ? " that 's also simple present tense . You might reply " No , I only go to the gym , " or " No , I never stop at the pub . " Of course , the truthful response may be " Yes , I often stop at the pub , " but whatever the reply , you 're using the simple present tense as did your spouse . <p> But if you say " The ball is caught by the dog , " magic happens . Because the first noun ( ball ) is acted upon by an external agency ( the dog ) , who performs the verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This works with any passive voice simple present tense sentence : " The moon is illuminated by the sun , " or " The barking is done by the dog " or " The stock exchange is affected by the value of the dollar . " <p> Those are the basic rules when it comes to the simple present tense in English . If you werent able to get 100% on the exercises above , you can now try again with your new knowledge of how this tense works ! 
@@12747210 @1347210/ <h> Are Acronyms Words ? <p> As you know , acronyms are letters or phrases that we often use in the same way as we use words . For example , NATO and NASA are acronyms . You just read each as they stand . Sometimes , acronyms do n't  sound quite right when you read then as words . For example , in a sentence about the FDA , you pronounce each letter of FDA as you would when saying the alphabet , instead of phonetically . <p> Its important to remember each letter of an acronym represents a word , so acronyms are n't  the same as abbreviations . For instance , we might abbreviate " street " as " St. " or " avenue " as " Ave . " The letters do n't  stand for distinct words as they do with acronyms . <p> Then there are acronyms that are composed of syllables , just to make things a bit more confusing . An example of such an acronym would be " Benelux . " It stands for three countries : Belgium , the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acronym rather than just one . <h> So , Are Acronyms Words ? <p> Linguists seem to agree that acronyms really are words . The linguistic phenomenon they represent is known as " blending , " and although the use of acronyms was once a lot rarer than it is today , we can quite safely say that acronyms are words , even if they do n't  appear in any dictionary . <p> Some acronyms are so well-used that instead of asking if these acronyms are words , we use them as such without ever realizing they are acronyms . If anyone ever argues with you when you assert that acronyms are words , you can use these examples to catch them off guard . <p> Base jumping : Have you ever wondered why jumping from high places is called base jumping ? In this case , " base " stands for the kinds of things you can jump off if you 're really crazy : Building , Aerial , Span or Earth . <p> Captcha : Have you ever wondered why the letters and numbers we type in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time for the next bit of trivia ! It stands for " Completely Automated Public Turning Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart . " <p> Care packages : Most people think a care package is sent to show that someone cares , and this acronym was probably deliberately developed so that people would make that association . In fact , it stands for " Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere . " <p> Gestapo : Well , its German , so people can be pardoned for not realizing its an abbreviation for " Geheime Staatspolize , " but now you do ! <p> Radar and Sonar : Surprised ? So was I ! They stand for " Radio Detection and Ranging " and " Sound Navigation and Ranging " respectively . If anyone should argue that an acronym ca n't be a word , these two words will provide the clinchers to the ensuing argument . <p> Scuba : Now that were getting into the swing of things , you may like to hazard a guess , but its unlikely you 'll guess " Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus . " Diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say the whole thing , " I 'm just going Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus diving this weekend . " <p> Laser When you read " laser " in an article , there 's a pretty good chance the true meaning of this acronym ( Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ) does n't  instantly pop into your mind . This is another example of how we use acronyms as words without even realizing it . <p> Zip Codes : You guessed it . " Zip " is an acronym . It stands for Zone Improvement Plan . While you may debate whether or not the plan actually worked to improve the zones , there 's no denying that this acronym is often used without people knowing that it is one . <p> For the purpose of counting words when writing an essay , article or book , word counters will treat acronyms as a single word rather than as all the words within their meaning . This can be frustrating when you 're trying to reach a certain word count , but a benefit when you 're attempting to reduce word count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince the person you 're debating with that an acronym is really a word ? While we never would encourage you to actually use physical force , you may become frustrated enough to consider using Thomas A. Swifts Electric Rifle on them . What 's that ? A taser of course ! <h> 5 comments <p> This actually ended up being more interesting that I thought it was going to be when I arrived here . I guess we take for granted that a word is a word even when it is formed from an acronym . I feel like I got a little smarter today which is always a good thing . <p> I totally disagree with this ! Acronyms are letters that represent words , not words in themselves . Just because we understand what these letters represent when they 're said without pronouncing each word does n't  make the acronym a word . Saying that they are is just plain wrong ! <p> I think its appropriate to consider some acronyms is words and others is not . I think that if you say the acronym as you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . But if you say the acronym by saying each of the individual letters within the acronym , then its not a word . So whether you consider one to be a word or not should depend on how you pronounce it . <p> I like this explanation of one an acronym is a word and when it is n't . I would n't consider the NRA ( National Rifle Association ) to be a word because you say each individual letter when pronouncing it . Each of those letters represents a word unto itself . On the other hand , I would consider NASA to be a word because we say it is a word . I 'm just repeating what you have said , but I think that makes a lot of sense .

There are certain times when this is useful , but its not needed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely a very small percentage . <p> I have a question . Why is it that when you 're doing alphabetical order , numbers are always put in front of letters . Isnt the term alphabetical mean that the most important information is that that 's in the alphabets ? Numbers are n't  part of the alphabet . Shouldnt they be at the end when you 're alphabetizing instead of at the beginning ? <p> You must not work with long lists that need to be put in alphabetical order . It could take me hours to do it by hand , or I can copy and paste them into a tool like this and have it done in minutes . it makes me so much more productive since I 'm not wasting my time doing something that the tool can do better . <p> I did n't  know I needed this tool until I was given a list of over 1000 email addresses that needed to be alphabetized .

If you think this word is a rather cruel joke at the expense of those who have this phobia , you 're absolutely right . If you have collapsed into a quivering heap , you are n't  reading this anyway , so well continue without fear of reprisals . <p> Luckily , even though most people do n't  like extremely long words , few people have an actual phobia of- them . If they did , it would be a little kinder to use the scientifically accepted term . Unfortunately , although its a little shorter , it is n't that much better .

It means " the ability to receive honors , " but its not only its length that makes it stand out ; it also uses alternating consonants and vowels and is the longest word to have this interesting characteristic . <p> **28;583;TOOLONG is the longest word in the Oxford Dictionary that was n't just invented and that is n't a technical term . Unless you are concerned about the disestablishment of the Church of England as the official church in England and Wales , it probably is n't worth learning . <p> LONG ... a technical term for a medical condition caused by inhaling silica dust , is the longest word to be listed in a formal dictionary .

The truth is there are probably as many reasons to blog as there are blogs , but there are some general reasons why it makes sense for most people to blog . While this is n't anywhere close to a comprehensive list , here is a few answers to the question , " Why should I blog ? " <h> Promote Yourself and/or Your Business <p> This is probably the biggest reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost your online presence , you need to add new content regularly . Businesses often hire freelance writers to provide regular injections of new content to improve their search engine visibility . This also applies to brick and mortar businesses since most people look for information online these days . <p> Private individuals can also build credibility and a strong reputation through a blog . If you write about your area of specialty , you will be able to refer prospective employers to your blog so that they can see you know your subject well . <h> Keep a Diary of Life Events <p> Paper diaries can be lost or stolen , but a blog is much more difficult to lose . No matter where you are , you can go online and post a story about your experiences . Some people keep a blog because they have serious problems they want to get off their chests , others want to keep a record , and some want to immortalize important life events such as having a baby . <p> If you want to keep your blog private , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public visibility in the hope of meeting like-minded fellow bloggers . <h> Improve Your Writing and Verbal Skills <p> Writers and aspiring writers are often avid bloggers , but even a student can improve his or her writing skills by regularly writing blog posts . Practice does help you- write better , and if you blog frequently , you 'll see your writing style improves . You 'll also become more confident and expressive as you go along . Plus , it can be fun making friends in the blogging community and reading their work for inspiration . As you use words to express yourself in writing , a side benefit is you may become more confident as a speaker . <h> Share Your Hobbies and Interests <p> If you have a relatively unusual hobby , you may struggle to find people who share your passion for vegetable instruments or your dedication to producing historically accurate models of famous battles . The good news is you can find all sorts of people online , and through your blog , you can get in touch with people who share your interest . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of all your completed projects and the process that went into them . This will be interesting to those who would like to follow your example , and you can also get fresh ideas from other people who are doing similar projects or tasks . <h> Make Money <p> If you can build up a popular blog , you can make money from- it . Even smaller blogs can bring in part-time income . There are a wide variety of ways to create income from a blog these days . That being said , making money from a blog does n't  start happening overnight . It usually takes several years of regular posting before you can build your blog to the point where it can make you some extra cash . <h> Draw Peoples Attention to Important Issues <p> If you 're passionate about an important issue , you can draw the publics attention to it and even influence public policy through your blog . In Wales , two junior school students drew the nations attention to poor conditions at their schools using their blogs . The government responded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote a charity or a cause , gaining support that could be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the organizations you promote . <h> Learn New Things <p> Let 's be frank ; you do n't  have to know a single thing about a topic you decide to blog about . But if you do your research well , you 'll know quite a lot about it by the time you 've finished writing your first post . If you write a series of posts on a topic , digging a little deeper every time , you could even become an expert . <h> Challenges Yourself and Build Self-Discipline <p> A good blog should be run on schedule . Some people post several times a day , others post once or twice a week . By developing a schedule and sticking to it , you 'll be practicing self-discipline . Its an important mental muscle we all need to work on which can benefit you in many other areas of life beyond blogging . Finding interesting things to write about and presenting them in a creative way is challenging , but itll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing you were equal to the challenge . <h> Your Personal Reasons <p> The above list of reasons to blog has been broad to include as many potential bloggers as possible . Most individuals will have specific and special reasons to blog that relate to only them . If you find yourself reading this article , chances are you already have reasons to blog but are simply looking for confirmation its something you should try . Once you begin , you 'll likely soon find you 'll want to improve your blogging productivity as the next step . <p> Youve just completed the report for your boss or written a business letter , or finished off your paper for your college professor . You run it through spelling and grammar checks , and there are no squiggly lines to show any possible errors . Youre convinced your work is perfect , but unless you take the time to proofread , it may not be nearly as perfect as you assume . If you get lazy , there 's a good chance you 'll make one of the following common writing errors : <h> Incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A full sentence will usually have an actor and an action , or to put it formally , a subject and a verb . Think of a sentence as a " thought . " The whole thought has to be expressed within the sentence . <p> " My cat is cross . Because she is feisty . " <p> The first sentence is fine , the second one is a fragment . You can either turn this thought into one sentence or change the second sentence to make it complete : " Because she is feisty , that often happens , " or simply , " She is feisty . " <h> Run-On Sentences <p> A lot of people think a " run-on " means the sentence is too long , but that 's not technically correct , although its often the case . If you use more than one subject and verb combination without using the correct punctuation , you have written a run-on sentence . <p> " I 'm not sure if hell settle down in China its often difficult for Westerners to adapt . " <p> Write two sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . Its often difficult for Westerners to adapt . " <p> Use a semi-colon : " I 'm not sure if hell settle down in China ; its often difficult for Westerners to adapt . " Read the article on semi-colon use to see why this easy fix works . <p> Use a conjunction : " I 'm not sure if hell settle down in China because its often difficult for Westerners to adapt . " <p> Another common run-on is called " comma splicing . " It means that you are joining two thoughts that could have been separate sentences with a comma . Use a semi-colon , add a conjunction , or split them into two sentences . <h> Similar Word Mistakes <p> This is awfully common . People write " your " when they mean " you 're , " they write " affect " when they mean " effect , " and they often mix up " its " and " its . " Unfortunately , these words are n't  interchangeable and have very different meanings . <h> Incorrect Tenses <p> Whatever you do , be careful how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do so , you need to follow the right formula . " I was putting on my makeup when the perfume bottle falls over , " is an example of incorrectly mixed tenses . <h> Comma Usage <p> It would be easy to write an entire blog post on when commas should and should n't be used . Its not really difficult to get your comma usage right , but you may have to study the subject carefully to gain an understanding of the rules . Since most people are muddled about where commas should go , you 'll be ahead of the pack if you can master the art . <h> Incoherent Flow <p> To keep your work crisp , clear , and concise , its important to organize your thoughts before you begin to write . If you do n't  , you could end up with a hodge-podge of ideas that do n't  make sense to your reader . What is the thought you 're trying to get across ? Introduce it . What points will you discuss in order to reinforce your central idea ? Organize them into paragraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together to a conclusion . <h> Singular Noun with Plural Pronoun ( or the other way around ) <p> This can be trickier than it sounds . For example : " When the student council got together , they decided to approach the dean with their problem . " It sounds fine , does n't  it ? What a pity its wrong . The student council is a single body or entity , therefore , it can not be a " they " . It may consist of people , but its not a person . Substitute " it " and " its " for " they " and " them " and alls well . <h> Too Complicated <p> Sometimes bosses like this sort of thing . Theyre impressed when you write " With regard to " instead of " Regarding " or " About . " They like " We are of the opinion " rather than " We think " and so on . Admittedly , none of these examples is actually wrong and does help you increase your word count , but using language like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been at loggerheads with many employers about clumsy , formal phrases . Business communication should be clear . <p> The other danger that lurks in wait for those hoping to sound impressive is long-winded sentences are much easier to get wrong . Writing simply and clearly makes your work easier for you to check , and reduces your opportunities for error . <p> here 's a lovely example of " correct " but long-winded writing : <p> A dual-member team proceeded toward the apex of a natural geological protuberance , the purpose of their expedition being the procurement of a sample of fluid hydride of oxygen in a large vessel , the exact size of which was unspecified . One member of the team precipitately descended , sustaining severe fractional damage to the upper cranial portion of the anatomical structure . Subsequently , the second member of the team performed a self-rotation translation oriented in the direction taken by the first team member . <p> What does this mean ? here 's the answer : <p> " Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill came tumbling after . " <h> Grocers Apostrophes <p> Youve seen the signs outside stores : " Apples , bananas and carrots special ! " Restaurants are also often guilty : " The best pizzas in town ! " Those apples may be on special , and maybe the pizzas are pretty good , but the apostrophe use is n't . Apostrophes signify a missing letter in an abbreviated word like " do n't  , " and they can indicate " belonging to " with the exception of " its . " The apostrophized version , in this case , is an abbreviation for " it is " . <p> And my favorite is a mistake I sometimes see when someone is signing off a letter and write " Kind retards . " To avoid these errors , read through your work carefully , preferably aloud . Spell check is helpful , but only up to a point ( or pint ) . <p> The reason you 're likely here reading this article is you need to know the spelling of " horderves " and not knowing it , you simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horderves , this is not the correct spelling . The correct spelling of horderves is hors doeuvres . <p> Of course , its not always necessary to know how to spell the foods you serve . Nobody is going to know you do n't  know how to spell the word correctly when you say " horderves " as you place out appetizers . On the other hand , if you 're writing an article and happen to want to talk about the appetizers you served using the " cuisine " word , it becomes a little more important to know the correct spelling . <h> Borrowing from the French <p> If you go into the origins of common words , you 'll discover that borrowing from the French is not that unusual : " cuisine " is basically French for cooking . Hors doeuvres is another word we have borrowed from the French . Directly translated , " hors " means " except " and " oeuvres " means " works . " This may not initially seem too helpful , but if you assume that the main course is " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning " outside , " the phrase basically means " outside the main course . " <p> Now you know something that most English-speaking people never stop to think about . Is it useful ? Possibly . You 're now in the position to give any dinner guests you may have over this little gem of information . <p> What probably wo n't make the grade as dinner table conversation is all the common misspellings for the word , but now that you know how its spelled , you 'll be able to see them everywhere . Some get the " hors " bit right as well as the " d " and its apostrophe , but then they spoil it by spelling the last bit as " oueveres " for hors doueveres . Youll be amazed at the number of permutations . <p> Perhaps one day , well adopt the word into the English language by changing the spelling to one that makes more sense to us , in which case , itll likely become " horderves " or " orderves . " <h> Taking It to the Next Level <p> Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hors doeuvres , you also get two ways of serving hors doeuvres . You can place the dishes on the table and let everyone help themselves , or you can have somebody pass the dish around allowing guests to select what they want to eat . Now you can make the distinction between " table " hors doeuvres and " butler-style " or " butlered " hors doeuvres . <h> Not Quite the Same as Hors DOeuvres <p> Now that you know how to use this chic French word to describe starters , you need to be careful that you do n't  get muddled up and use it in the wrong place . It will spoil the great impression you 'll make by knowing how to spell the word , how to serve them and what the French words actually mean . <p> Canapes are not hors doeuvres . Instead of being foods you use to start off a meal , they 're savory finger-snacks that are served at cocktail hour . <p> Antipasto is also not the same as hors doeuvres . Although it consists of a range of dishes served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and antipasto is always served at the table . You can still call it a starter , and if you want to use French , you could call it an entree . <p> A smorgasbord is also not the same as hors doeuvres . Like antipasto , it is served before the meal and consists of foods that are related to the Scandinavian culture from which the word has been borrowed . <p> You can now go forth and charm your dinner guests . You now not only know how to spell " hors doeuvres , " but how to serve them , what they are , and what they are not . Your culinary education may not be complete , but you 're off to a good start . At least you 'll never have to eat your words . <p> Transition words are words or phrases used to link ideas together . They help your reader to see more than one point is important and both should be taken into consideration . They also indicate different ideas in the same paragraph or sentence are related . <p> Let 's get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearer . This wont give you the full list of transition words , but will make it possible to easily recognize them . These words can be used to show two things agree with each other , are similar to each other , or you 're giving additional information . <p> When you are adding information or reinforcing an idea you might use one of the following transition words : <p> Also <p> In addition <p> Likewise <p> In the first place <p> Not only ( an additional also comes into the sentence when you use this one ) <p> Not to mention <p> By the same token <p> Coupled with <p> In the light of <p> Equally <p> Some of these are also short , basic words such as : <p> And <p> To <p> Again <p> Also <p> Like <p> Then <p> Transition words can be used to point out a contradiction , a limitation or an opposing point of view : <p> Rather than <p> Although this may be true <p> On the contrary <p> In contrast <p> Despite <p> In reality <p> Then again <p> Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But <p> Rather <p> Or <p> Yet <p> While <p> Albeit <p> Notwithstanding <p> When you are trying to link cause and effect , write about something that is conditional or express an intention , you may also use transitional words : <p> In the event of ( or that ) <p> For the purpose of <p> Inasmuch as <p> For fear that <p> As long as <p> Granted that <p> With this in mind <p> In order to <p> In view of <p> Because of <p> With this intention <p> If <p> Unless <p> While <p> When <p> Whenever <p> Another time you 'd use these words is when you want to give an example , support a point or emphasize it : <p> Especially <p> In other words <p> For one thing <p> For this reason <p> That is to say <p> In this case <p> Must be remembered <p> For example <p> Notably <p> Like <p> Truly <p> Chiefly <p> Expressly <p> Significantly <p> In fact <p> We also use transitional words to show that something has a consequence or result : <p> Accordingly <p> In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under these circumstances <p> Hence <p> Therefore <p> Henceforth <p> Forthwith <p> We use them to make conclusions too : <p> Generally speaking <p> All things considered <p> In the long run <p> As shown <p> In conclusion <p> In a word <p> As has been noted <p> Given that <p> After all <p> In short <p> By and large <p> In any event <p> All in all <p> Obviously <p> Definitely <p> Ultimately <p> and to define a time period <p> At the present time <p> Presently <p> From time to time <p> Sooner or later <p> At the same time <p> Simultaneously <p> To begin with <p> Meanwhile <p> Eventually <p> Finally <p> Last <p> Until <p> Before <p> Whenever <p> Next <p> Now <p> Lastly ( did you spot the transition word there ? ) , transition words can indicate a place or space : <p> In the middle <p> Central to <p> In the center of <p> Adjacent to <p> Opposite to <p> In front of <p> Near <p> Below <p> Under <p> Down <p> Up <p> Beyond <p> Amid <p> Across <p> Alongside <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are- actually wrong , I 'm inclined to think that using simple , straightforward language is best . This means that you often do n't  need to use many of the transition words listed above . <p> For example , I 'm guilty of using " in addition , " but I could just as easily say " also " or even " and . " As for " albeit " and " notwithstanding , " I 'm inclined to think that " but " and " nevertheless " are every bit as good and much more accessible to a reader . " For the purpose of " is also one I 'll admit to using , but it can easily be reduced to three letters . I prefer " for " and it will do the job just as well most of the time . As for " At the present time , " the word " now " is really all we need . " In the event of " is similar . It can be replaced with the two letter word " if . " <p> You 'll usually only use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be helpful . After all , although your choice of transition words may not necessarily impress your teacher , you can use the longer phrases to stretch your word count . Remember , every time you write " in the event of " instead of " if " that 's three words towards your target word count instead of one . " For the purpose of " could just be " for , " but then you only get one word instead of four . Transition words are handy , and everyone uses them a lot , but be careful about using excessively wordy ones unnecessarily . <p> As you know , acronyms are letters or phrases that we often use in the same way as we use words . For example , NATO and NASA are acronyms . You just read each as they stand . Sometimes , acronyms do n't  sound quite right when you read then as words . For example , in a sentence about the FDA , you pronounce each letter of FDA as you would when saying the alphabet , instead of phonetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acronym represents a word , so acronyms are n't  the same as abbreviations . For instance , we might abbreviate " street " as " St. " or " avenue " as " Ave . " The letters do n't  stand for distinct words as they do with acronyms . <p> Then there are acronyms that are composed of syllables , just to make things a bit more confusing . An example of such an acronym would be " Benelux . " It stands for three countries : Belgium , the Netherlands , and Luxembourg , and each country gets two letters in the acronym rather than just one . <h> So , Are Acronyms Words ? <p> Linguists seem to agree that acronyms really are words . The linguistic phenomenon they represent is known as " blending , " and although the use of acronyms was once a lot rarer than it is today , we can quite safely say that acronyms are words , even if they do n't  appear in any dictionary . <p> Some acronyms are so well-used that instead of asking if these acronyms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are acronyms . If anyone ever argues with you when you assert that acronyms are words , you can use these examples to catch them off guard . <p> Base jumping : Have you ever wondered why jumping from high places is called base jumping ? In this case , " base " stands for the kinds of things you can jump off if you 're really crazy : Building , Aerial , Span or Earth . <p> Captcha : Have you ever wondered why the letters and numbers we type in to show were human are called " captchas ? " Time for the next bit of trivia ! It stands for " Completely Automated Public Turning Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart . " <p> Care packages : Most people think a care package is sent to show that someone cares , and this acronym was probably deliberately developed so that people would make that association . In fact , it stands for " Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere . " <p> Gestapo : Well , its German , so people can be pardoned for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now you do ! <p> Radar and Sonar : Surprised ? So was I ! They stand for " Radio Detection and Ranging " and " Sound Navigation and Ranging " respectively . If anyone should argue that an acronym ca n't be a word , these two words will provide the clinchers to the ensuing argument . <p> Scuba : Now that were getting into the swing of things , you may like to hazard a guess , but its unlikely you 'll guess " Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus . " Diving would be way less sexy-sounding as a sport if people had to say the whole thing , " I 'm just going Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus diving this weekend . " <p> Laser When you read " laser " in an article , there 's a pretty good chance the true meaning of this acronym ( Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ) does n't  instantly pop into your mind . This is another example of how we use acronyms as words without even realizing it . <p> Zip Codes : You guessed it . " Zip " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While you may debate whether or not the plan actually worked to improve the zones , there 's no denying that this acronym is often used without people knowing that it is one . <p> For the purpose of counting words when writing an essay , article or book , word counters will treat acronyms as a single word rather than as all the words within their meaning . This can be frustrating when you 're trying to reach a certain word count , but a benefit when you 're attempting to reduce word count . <p> What if all these examples are n't  sufficient to convince the person you 're debating with that an acronym is really a word ? While we never would encourage you to actually use physical force , you may become frustrated enough to consider using Thomas A. Swifts Electric Rifle on them . What 's that ? A taser of course ! <p> There are numerous places where you 're only expected to leave a brief comment when you write a review . For example , an Amazon review consists of allocating a star rating and writing anything from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of paragraphs to explain just why you think the product or vendor is or is n't great . You can say whatever you like . Nobodys going to expect a structured review article . They just want to know if you think the product is any good or not , and your opinion allows them to compare reviews with those- of others . <p> If , however , you want to write a more serious review on a book , movie or product , you 'll be writing a full article , and that means you need to apply some sort of structure . There are no hard and fast rules , and you may be limited to some degree as many times reviews will have word count limits , but this is how I like to approach a review article . <h> Introduce the Thing You Are Reviewing <p> Your reader wants to know exactly what you are reviewing . If its a book or a movie , theyd like to know whether previous efforts by the same author or movie maker were well-received . If its a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made it , and perhaps some historical background on the manufacturers or their products . <p> Remember , you know what you 're reviewing because you 've seen it , heard it , tasted it , touched it , used it , or otherwise consumed it in whatever form its intended to be consumed . Your reader does n't  . Provide readers with the information they need about the item you 're reviewing in your very first paragraph . <p> In some cases , particularly when you 're reviewing a product , telling your reader why you felt the need to buy it can also help . Give your " why " before or after your " what . " Now your reader will know what you are talking about and what need the item fulfills . <h> What Did You Like and Dislike About the Product ? <p> Although there are some things you 'll review that do n't  have a single good thing about them , that 's pretty rare . For example , a book I recently read was based on a puerile premise and was packed with plot cliches , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . <p> For the sake of getting to the point , I usually begin with whatever made the biggest impression . In my example , I 'd kick off with the things that annoyed me about the book . Giving reasons for your opinion helps your reader to decide whether the things you did or did n't  like would be the kind of things they identify with . For example : " With its focus on cliched , pulp fiction plotlines that are so full of holes you could use them as a colander , xxx book turned out to be an annoying read . I felt the reader wasnt being credited with intelligence and the author was n't really trying . " <p> But it would n't be fair to only give my opinion on the things I did n't  like , so I might follow that up with : " The authors writing style is nevertheless beautiful the only reason why I persevered with the story all the way through to its unsurprising ending . " <h> What Could Make It More Acceptable to You ? <p> Even when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of improvement . At the risk of annoying its many fans , I could say that the book War and Peace is a trifle too long , for example . After all , a review is an expression of opinions , and you or I can have any opinions we like as long as we can back them up with information . Using my silly book ( not War and Peace ) as an example , I would probably say : " If the same author could come up with a more original and less sentimental plotline instead of rehashing a formula , I 'd be very interested in seeing the result . " <h> Sum It All Up <p> Lazy readers , which is to say most people , will read your opening paragraph and then skim down to your concluding paragraph to see if you actually did arrive at a conclusion . This paragraph briefly sums up the main points you 've highlighted and may end with a call to action such as " Boycott this hotel ! " or " Try it for yourself , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> More Serious Reviews <p> Most reviews follow the structure we 've discussed above . If you 're being asked for a subjective opinion , you can back it up by describing how you arrived at it , but sometimes you have to write a " literature review . " This means you have to track down all the published literature you can find on a certain topic and piece it together with references so that you can draw a coherent conclusion that is supported by the accepted academic works you 've discovered . Its much harder to do , and its nevertheless not as daunting as you might think , but that 's a topic for a future article . <p> There is a lot of confusion when it comes to the Oxford comma and whether or not it should be used . To make matters worse , there was a time when school children were taught they should never use the Oxford comma . That 's no longer the case today . <p> While Oxford commas are strictly optional , different style guides will tell you different things about them . Simply put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conjunction such as " and , " " but , " or " if . " - Journalists often dispense with it , but doing so can make their writing more difficult to understand . <p> I had a client who queried my use of this useful little punctuation mark for any reason , but when I showed him what consequences could befall if it was omitted ( and proved that it really is acceptable to use it ) he had to give in . Actually , he told me he was quite relieved because his boss often used it and he had been forcibly restraining himself from saying anything about the error. <h> Can You Put a Comma Before And ? <p> Not only can you place a comma before an and , sometimes its important you do . Let 's look at some of the ways an Oxford comma can help to prevent you from saying something outrageous you did n't  really mean . Take a look at this sentence : <p> " I called my parents , my counselor and my teacher . " <p> There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I might think that your counselor and your teacher were your parents . Are you confused ? Well , let 's say your parents are called John and Mary . How would you say you spoke to them ? Youd probably say : <p> " I spoke to my parents , John and Mary . " <p> Do you see where the comma is ? Now let 's assume that John and Mary are n't  your parents , but that you spoke to them as well as speaking to your parents . <p> " I spoke to my parents , John , and Mary . " <p> In this sentence , its an Oxford comma which clarifies exactly who you happen to be talking to . <p> The lack of an Oxford comma might add some extra confusion as to who you are talking to : <p> " I had fish , coffee and dessert . " <p> " I had fish , coffee , and desert " <p> If we were to split hairs , my first sentence could be me talking to my coffee and dessert in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearer and shows I had all three of these things and I 'm not actually talking to any of them . <p> If you are n't  convinced yet , here are some real-life examples when journalists probably should have used the Oxford comma when writing their article headlines . <p> The lack of a comma is the difference from worldwide breaking news and a recap of what happened that particular day . Obama to marry Castro ? Who would have thought it ? A simple Oxford comma would have eliminated any confusion . <p> here 's another example . The Times of London reported that Peter Ustinov went on a tour and met a number of interesting people or perhaps he met a single one who had habits we never knew about : <p> " Highlights of his global tour included encounters with Nelson Mandela , an 800-year-old demi-god and a dildo collector . " <p> We always knew Mandela was old when he passed away , but nobody knew he was 800 years old , and he had an affinity for collecting sex toys . The insertion of the Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when reading that sentence . <p> There are those who hate the Oxford comma . The AP style guide says that the serial comma or Oxford comma is wrong . Other style guides say that its OK and that it can eliminate confusion as to your meaning . Generally speaking , there is no right or wrong answer to this question . While some people get quite passionate about arguing for or against this little punctuation mark coming before a conjunction , its not worth getting worked up about either way in most situations . What 's important to remember is there are instances where adding it can eliminate ambiguity . <p> Little words can make a big difference as to how powerful and persuasive your writing is . Although some bloggers have tried to make long lists of power words , almost any word can become powerful . It just depends on how you use it . Power words forge an emotional connection , they indicate action and achievement , or they make people feel they 're right there with you . The reason you write has a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Marketing <p> Let 's suppose I 'm a fitness expert and on my website , my slogan is " Feel good about your body . " That 's pretty strong already , but almost anyone can feel good about their body , even if they are overweight and a couch potato . <p> Let 's make that more powerful : " Feel good about your body again . " Now I 'm implying that you do n't  feel good about your body , but there was a time when you did , and that if you take action , you 'll feel better about it . Suddenly , my slogan says a whole lot more . Our overweight couch potato is less likely to say , " I feel fine about my body , thanks , " and is more likely to say , " Yes , I 'd like to feel good about my body in the same way I used to when I was trim and active . " <p> One word engages the imagination . In our example , those who know they used to feel better about their bodies than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that feeling again . They have a reason to read on to find out how the fitness training can help them . <p> Power words engage the emotions and the imagination in marketing . Have you ever noticed that marketers will say things like " This could be you , " or " Imagine " followed by some vision of loveliness that you definitely can imagine and certainly would want . <p> Other power words marketers love are " scientifically proven , " " innovative , " or " unique . " But be careful how you use them . People are becoming suspicious of the most commonly used power words . <p> For example , when I see the word " innovative , " I 'm no longer convinced . 90% of companies will tell you that they or their products are " innovative . " How are they all innovative ? They may have some difficulty explaining . In fact , their business or its products may be very similar to their competitors . That means they are n't  innovative at all . <p> Instead of using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your customers shoes and ask yourself what words would have an impact on them . What emotions relate to the need your product is trying to address ? <p> Will you relieve your customers worries and fears ? <p> Will you enhance their status ? <p> Can you improve their social life ? <p> Will they be entertained or amused ? <p> Are they likely to have a better self-image if they choose what you 're selling ? <p> What words will bring the feelings behind these needs across powerfully ? Just be sure that what you 're offering really can deliver on the promise your words imply . For example , I once did some writing for a guy who had an invoicing service . One of his slogans was " Get paid faster . " I 'm all in favor of that ! That 's powerful stuff ! I especially like " paid " and " faster . " But he proved to be an excruciatingly slow payer , even when I used his own invoicing and reminder service to bill him . Do I use it now ? Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you 're writing a resume , you obviously have to be much more formal , but you still want to use power words . Its just the type of words that become powerful that differ . In resume writing , you want to highlight the things you 've done , so doing words become more important . <p> Most experts will tell you to start each sentence describing your work history with a past tense verb . For example , words like " achieved , " " designed , " " conceived , " " coordinated , " " generated , " " exceeded , " and " implemented " are all considered powerful when writing a resume . Some recruiters even have software that looks for them and draws them to HR managers attention . <h> Power Words for Writers <p> Its not just people selling their services as employees and those who want to persuade you to buy their products or services that use power words . Nothing could be more powerful than the carefully chosen words used in great works of literature . How do they sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so you simply cant put a book down till you 've finished it ? Its the power words that writers use that make us feel as if were part of a story . <p> A good writer can stir us to want to make war or inspire us to love . They can make us laugh or cry , believe in their cause or identify with the feelings of fictional characters who never existed in reality . They can make us feel as if were in the midst of a bustling city or alone on a misty mountaintop . That 's the power of words . <p> Almost any word can be a power word , depending on how you use it . Adjectives , adverbs , and words that express or evoke emotions are among these , but as we 've seen , a simple word like " again " can add power to a phrase . <p> How long is a piece of string ? How tall is a tree ? As we so often find , there is no single answer to certain questions , and the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these . There are so many variables that come into play it would be difficult to enumerate them all , but generally speaking , the volume of text , the complexity of the subject matter and the amount of time a writer can actually devote to his or her writing are among the factors that would influence the answer . For those looking for the most rudimentary of guidelines , it takes a year to write a book . Now that has been written , its also important to point out that the year-to-book timeline does n't  really apply to anything more than a framework to get some writers started . <h> Some of the quickest books to write <p> E-books : The fastest Ive ever written an e-book from beginning to end was just one week . It consisted of 25,000 words , which would have made it a bit short if the book were to be printed for an adult reading audience ; but for an e-book , it was relatively substantial . The topic required quite a lot of research , so if I 'd picked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train for a marathon , " I estimate I could have finished even faster . <p> Heavily illustrated books : Kids books for a very young reading audience and coffee table books that consist mainly of images can be even quicker to write . I 've knocked off a kids story in less than an hour , and just captioning images does n't  take long when eye-candy is the principal selling point of a book . That does n't  mean the book will be ready in that amount of time . Since these books are n't  primarily about writing , the writing is the easiest and quickest part of the process . The other aspects ( photography , illustrations ) will take much longer . <p> Recipe books : It does n't  take long to write a recipe book , but if you take time spent in the kitchen testing your recipes and taking photographs of your mouth-watering results into account , it can turn into quite a lengthy project . But the actual writing ? It does n't  take long at all . <h> What about your magnum opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many words youd write a day if you worked on your literary masterpiece all day every day , but everyone has their own pace , and some days are better than others . In general , I manage a word count of about 4,000 words on a writing a day provided I have direction and know what comes next . I edit on the following day , and that takes anything from half the day to the whole day , depending on my form when I drafted the original text , my mood , and whether I 'm feeling self-confident on the day . That brings down the final number to about 2,000 words a day when averaging it out . <p> If you 're really writing something that means a lot to you , completing your book could take years . A friend of mine decided she needed to change the focus of her autobiographical work when she was already halfway through writing it . I think it was the right decision , but it meant she had to go back and revise absolutely everything shed already written . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted her science fiction story . One publisher was kind enough to tell her what he thought needed changing , and she 's been reworking the whole thing by fits and starts ever since . <p> Even non-fiction works can take ages to compile . Edward Gibbons " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire " took 20 years to complete , but it is still considered to be the definitive work on Roman history . Meanwhile , " The Cantos " by Ezra Pound took a massive 52 years to write , and he would probably still be writing it if he were still alive . The unfinished book was published after his death in 1969 . <p> Then again , Mickey Spillane is said to have written his first novel in just 19 days , and Earle Stanley Gardener used to publish four books every year . Could detective fiction be one of the easiest genres to tackle ? However , Jack Kerouac takes the cake with " On the Road " a book that he is said to have completed over a single weekend . Mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to digest . <h> Anything from a week to a lifetime <p> here 's the bottom line : depending on a whole range of factors , writing a book could take you as little as a week or as long as a lifetime . If you 're serious about writing a book and getting it published before you depart from this mortal coil , I 'd advise you to get started now . Create a framework to guide you through the chapters you have to write , and set mini-deadlines for yourself so that you 're forced to keep working at it . If you receive rejection letters , see if you can distil any valuable information from them . Then go back to your book and see if you can accommodate the ideas you 've been given without completely deconstructing your story and starting over . The sooner you can get it back to the kind publisher who actually took the trouble of reading your proof and commenting on it , the greater your chance of getting it published .

That 's great , but now you need to come up with a plan to make that happen that 's simple enough to help you reach the goal , yet allows you to write enough to complete a book within a year . One easy and effective way to accomplish the book-in-a-year goal is to take the 365-day book writing challenge . <p> The concept of this challenge is simple enough that any writer , no matter what their level , should be able to follow it to reach their goal . Most people who decide they want to write a book fail because they try to do too much in too little amount of time . This challenge leverages the fact there are 365 days in a year and that you want to build a daily writing habit . <p> The book writing challenge works in the following way . Once you decide to begin , each day you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to shoot for writing the highest number of words you can to cross the highest number off the chart , but as long as you write any number of words which corresponds with a number that 's still available on the chart , you 're golden . At the end of the day , you place an " x " on the chart over the number of words you wrote that day . Each day you do this for the entire year and at the end , you will have written 66,795 words . Even more importantly , you 'll have established a daily writing habit which you can then use to write your next book in even less time . <h> 365 Day Book Writing Challenge ( click on image to print PDF ) <p> To be successful in this challenge , there are a few important steps you should take . First , you should print out the challenge sheet . Once done , you should put it somewhere where you 'll see it daily . Tape it to the top of your laptop computer or hang it on the bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible so you are reminded each day you need to write , even if its only a little bit . This visual reminder will help you reach your daily goal of writing and the ultimate goal of finishing your book . <p> The second rule is you are n't  allowed to go to bed until you have crossed off one of the numbers on the sheet . There really is no excuse not to cross off one of the numbers . The truth is that if you are unable to cross off a number each day of the year with all of the smaller word counts available , you 're not serious about writing the book . In a way , its a test to determine if you are willing to take the actions necessary to write the book , or if you just say you want to , but its only words . That may sound a bit harsh , but if you cant write a few words each day- no matter what happens in life , writing the book is n't a priority in your life . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . <p> Another key about this challenge which increases your likelihood of success is that it takes into account the reality of life . There are going to be busy days and days when the unexpected happens and you wont be able to write as much as you hoped . You should always shoot for the highest word count number still available on the sheet , but when a day comes when that is n't possible , crossing off a smaller number is perfectly acceptable . <p> While having a book written at the end of the year is a huge deal , the biggest benefit of this challenge is something you 'll gain that 's far more important . This challenge requires you to write every day . Even the days when you 're only able to write a word or two , you must sit down and write something . That daily writing will turn into a daily routine by the end of the year . Once you have established that habit , you have created a foundation which will allow you to write far more the following year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past but have failed in getting it done , I encourage you to try the 365-day book writing challenge . It has a lot of things going for it that other challenges do n't  , which increases the likelihood you 'll actually complete it and reach your goal . Best of all , at the end of the year , you 'll have a book written and you 'll have the skill-set in place to write as many more as you want to in the future . <p> I like the way you have set this up . Its impossible for me to write every day because of my schedule , but the days that I do write I have a good amount of time to write . I can cross off several numbers each time I am able to sit down and write , I should be able to complete this even before the year is up . Thanks for the creative idea . <p> I did something similar . If I wrote more than 365 words during the day , I would cross off more than one box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was able to cross off 10 boxes that day . My only goal was that I had to cross off at least one box each day and I ended up finishing all the boxes in less than six months . Its another great way to attack this challenge if you want to try it at a speed faster than a year . <p> This is a great challenge for upcoming writers or anyone who is looking to write their first book . Everything is set out perfectly and it is easy to follow all you need is to motivate yourself to complete it . Ive been doing ti for about 6 months now and it has helped me write a lot more than I would have ever done so without it . I think its the requirement to write every day even if its only one word . That means even if you cant write much , you 're always thinking about writing . <p> This is a lot like the money challenges that are going around . I think its a great alternative for writers . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems like a good way to make sure I spend a little time each day writing ! <p> Yes , its very similar to that , but replaces saving money with writing words on a daily basis . Both are good ways to form ongoing habits so that saving money ( or writing in this case ) becomes something you do automatically each day . <p> I want to write a book . Can I write a book in a year using this method ? I have a great idea for a book and I 'm sure it will e a best seller . How can I get someone to pay me to write this book since it will be such a success ? I cant wait to get started ! ! <p> I think you 're getting a little ahead of yourself . Nobody knows whether or not their book is going to be a bestseller or make a lot of money before its actually written . In fact , if you are going around saying that your book will be a bestseller before you have the ever written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do to actually write a bestseller . <p> It takes a lot of work in energy beyond writing the book . before you go around telling everybody that you 're going to write a bestseller , you might want to actually write the book . Then people can read it and judge it on its own merits . <p> A story formula that is magic . Story must include : deity , hierarchy , sex , mystery . Learned this in college and it works like a charm ! My teacher had a short he wrote : " Oh my God " said the princess , " I 'm pregnant . I wonder who did it ? " And then go from there . Working on a fanfic for the marvel verse with frostiron as the main pair . It has everything at we are at 44,000 and counting ! <p> You do n't  have to write 365 words each day . You can write 1 word or 365 whatever number you have on the chart that you have n't yet crossed off . That 's where the 66.795 words come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to write a novel is to sit down and write it . If you want to be a novelist , then you have to take the job seriously and write each day like its your job . Stop dreaming about writing and actually write . I guess its ok to use this gimmick if it helps , but that 's all it is . You have to do the writing . <p> All writing is a gimmick in some way or another . The important thing is to figure out a way to motivate yourself to do the writing . If a system like this works , why not use it ? Just because the system may not work for you does n't  mean that it would work for other people . <p> I 'm planning on writing my first novel this year . I cant wait to get started . I think this is an excellent way to go about it . I can writ a little each day and at the end of 1 year I will have a novel . If I had written it stead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule ! ! ! lol . <p> I think the idea is just to remember even though itll take you 1 year to finish a novel , using this method that you only think about 1 box per day even if 365 are starting back at you , you really only need to think about 1 amount per day , even if you only do the first 31 boxes ( the lowest 31 that is ) , that 's only 496 words in 31 days , its very do able , b/c in the first month your doing less than 500 words , and since it takes the average person 21 days to create a new habit , after a month of doing this , itll just become a habit . <p> A little over a month ago , I realised I had n't  written regularly since the beginning of 2013 and it kind of devastated me . I love writing , but life just swept me up and I forgot to take the time to actually sit down and write . It led to a lot of frustration since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I did n't  have time to follow it . I found this challenge and decided to give it a try . I have written everyday but one for the past 31 days ( so 30 days of writing in total ) . One day I only wrote 34 ( I got caught up editing an old book of mine and did n't  count the editing as part of the challenge ) while I 've been over 1000 words six of the days . I did a count today and in the 30 days of writing I have written 16.718 words . I 'm not gon na lie , I am sitting here , grinning like an idiot and ready to burst with pride . Obviously you still have to do the work , but this has been a great tool for me to use and I am really happy I stumbled over it . <p> Always love to hear stories like this its exactly why I put together articles like this . I 'm so happy that I could help in some way , no matter how little , in getting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing your story . I 'm sure it will inspire someone else to give it a try and pass the inspiration onto someone who may not have tried just reading my article . I wish you the best of luck in continuing your writing success over the next 11 months ! <p> Its been a few months since you commented here about this method . I 'm wondering if you have an update on how its been going with this method . I like the idea od it , but I 'd like to get confirmation it actually works for some people before I try it . I 'd love to hear what you think is good and not so good from your experience trying it . <p> Its my dream to write a book . This chart makes it seem so easy to do . Is it really this easy ? Is there some kind of hidden catch that is n't explained here ? I never thought I could make my dream of writing a book come true , but this makes me think I could actually do it . But I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I wish you the best of luck in making your dream of writing a book true . If this chart helps you to make that dream possible , then it was worth creating . The key is finding the tricks that help you to write each and every day so that you can actually complete when you started . I hope that if this technique works for you , you will share when you have your book complete . <p> I decided to try this . I 've always wanted to write a book , and this seems like it could be a way to accomplish that . I 'm a little scared as I do n't  know if I have the fortitude to finish , but I want to at least try . I think we should all try to achieve out dreams even if were not sure we actually can . I hope to come back next year at this time and say that I have a book written ! <p> There is more to writing a book than writing 67,000 words . That 's just the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes multiple times . Where is the time for editing included in this plan ? You wont have a novel at the end of a year . Youll have a lot of words to be edited . There 's a big difference ! <p> I think you 're looking at this with a microscope when you should be looking at it as a general plan . The hardest part for most people who want to write a book is actually starting . Once they started , the hardest part is consistently writing . That 's all this system is claiming to do to help writers begin and to write consistently . You are technically correct that the book will not be finished and ready to take to the publisher in one year , but anyone who uses this method will be a lot farther along than if they just thought about writing a book . I think that 's the main point of this article . <p> What an amazing idea . Its definitely worth trying at least once . This is a way to make writing even more fun because it challenges you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a book in a year . <p> I have been in a battle for many years . An inner struggle between my flesh and spirit . Tonight the thought of waging war on paper for a full year gave me hope that victory may indeed be found after 365 days . So I determined that I would devote one year to this fight . THEN , I began looking on the web to find others who may have attempted something similar . I found your site immediately . Perhaps I will employ this strategy as a weapon in my pursuit of victory . Thank you . <p> If you do this challenge , you will have AT LEAST 66.795 words . I started this and most days I have many more words than the number I cross off the paper . I think this challenge is best for getting me to write every day and the number of words is a bonus . Its helped me a lot ! <p> I 'm going to try to do this in 2017 . Writing a book is one of my New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going about it . I hope it works and I can report back at this time next year that Ive written my first book ! <p> Everyone should write a book during their lifetime . It does n't  need to get published , but it should be written . There are so many benefits that come with doing it . I encourage everyone to give it a try . 
@@12747216 @1347216/ <h> Publisher Word Count for Magazine Writing <p> When you write an article or manuscript for a magazine , you 'll usually be asked to hit a predetermined word count . There would seem to be nothing complicated about this . Its the exact reason we created WordCounter . You place your writing into the text area and you instantly know the number of words you have typed . One would assume that magazine editors and other publishers would n't have any issue with this number . The problem is that they likely will . <p> Why is an accurate word count not useful to many publishers ? There is a simple reason that may not seem obvious at first , but it makes a lot of sense once its pointed out . Below is the reasons why we decided it was important to include a publisher word count in the details section for those who will be submitting their writing for publication . <h> Word Length <p> Word Counter counts the individual words written . " He is at a big park " is six words . " **34;687;TOOLONG " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six words take up 19 character spaces ( 20 if you place a period at the end ) while the single word takes up 34 character spaces . While the length of the words will even itself out to a certain degree over the length of ones writing , each writer will still produce different length articles even when they have the same word count . <p> When a publisher asks for a certain number of words , they are doing so in anticipation the writing will be the length needed to fill the space allotted for the article . Its the space the article fills which is of the utmost importance to the publisher , not the actual word count . The problem is that explaining to the writer the exact length can be complicated , so they give a word count and hope that produces writing that fills the space allotted for the article . An article with unusually long words would likely go over the anticipated length , while an article with many short words would fall short of the length needed by the publisher . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a publishers specific word count . Instead of counting each individual word , publishers have agreed upon the definition that a " word " is six characters long including blank spaces . This solves the issue of words being different lengths and gives a much more accurate estimate of space an article will use as compared to simply counting individual words . Using this definition , " He is at a big park . " would be three and one-third words ( including the period ) . On the other hand , " **34;723;TOOLONG " would be five and one-third words . <p> The Word Counter Publisher Count calculates a word to be six character spaces and applies it to your writing to come up with its total . This is n't perfect for publishers , but its a lot more accurate than counting individual words . If you are submitting work to a publisher , you can ask which of the two methods they would prefer when you attach a word count total to your submission . <p> While it may be interesting , it really does n't  apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work computers around where you can manipulate the fonts and sizes to make it work . I would be surprised if you found any magazines which would pay you by publishers word count rather than by a standard word count . <p> Ive been paid by using the publishers word count formula this year . I think its just a matter of which publisher you happen to be working with . Its definitely not as common as using standard word count , but there are still publishers to will use it , especially if it is for a print publication . <p> Using e publisher word count will almost always give you more words than the straight word count . If the editor does n't  care and you get paid by word for your articles , using publisher word count can increase your salary for an article by as much as 30% If you write for magazines or newspapers on a per word basis , this count is your friend . <p> i copied and pasted " The international level of the synaptic exchange between various idea that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meandering tropes which make up our existences through an intersectional framework all add to the propinquity of intradimensional experiences , all within a subpar trope that mellifluously delineates all our existences ' sakes . " three times and it said I was a college graduate . XD XD <p> Very interesting article and this makes so much more sense now . Although having a word count and a publishers word count that vary so greatly is a bit confusing as to which one I should write toward when I have a set word count to meet . Will definitely be utilizing this information in the future , but I hope it does n't  get me in trouble . <p> The publisher cares much more about the amount of space than will be filled than the actual word count . This is why they are willing to pay more for the correct space even if there are less words . It saves the editors a lot of time and hassle . <p> Wouldnt it make more sense to tell writers a character ( + space ) limit ? I 'm assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly how many characters or spaces could fit on a line . Give or take character space usage issues ( Extreme example : llllll vs mmmmmm ) I think it would be easier to determine the amount of space being used . <p> This probably makes sense , but I think word count is a standard industry metric whereas character count is n't so much . Then you get into the same problem with short sentences that maybe a paragraph in itself . You still have all that white space even with the character count . There probably is n't a perfect solution when it comes to doing this but the publishers word count is a bit more accurate than a standard word count . <p> You should always ask the publisher if they will accept this word count over the standard word count . There may be some that spell it out , but its far more common to have to ask if they will accept it for assignments . <p> I think its most common for publishers to ask for a standard word count . Its easier for writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers word count is . I also think the Internet is changing things since there is n't a limit of words and space when an article goes on the Internet ( as opposed to a magazine ) <p> Always ask first . Never assume you can use it or you 'll end up being disappointed . It really depends on the publisher . Some use it and others do n't  . There is no rhyme or reason to it as far as I can see , <p> Since finding this tool , I 've started writing both when I submit my freelance writing . I assume the publisher will pay me with the lower word count , but have been surprised a couple of times being paid the larger word count . Thats added about $50 to my fees I never expected to get . Since both are displayed on the tool , its worthwhile and it might make you a few extra bucks . <p> Oh , I like this idea ! There does n't  seem to be any risk or downside by including both of them and there 's a chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do your writing based on a regular word count when you submit ? I think that I 'm going to start doing this as well and see what happens . <p> I 've tried using the publishers word count several times and none of the online magazines I submitted would accept it . They all wanted a regular word count . How can I convince the publishers to accept the publishers were count instead of the regular word count so I can get paid more for my writing ? <p> Online magazines are n't  going to care about publishers word count . They are n't  limited in space in the same way a physical magazine or newspaper is . If you 're writing to be published online there 's a lot more flexibility than if you 're writing for a regular magazine . Publishers word count will only apply to physical magazines . <p> As writers , we all want to make sure our word counts are correct . For that reason , I think this article is a great guideline to explain how to do this when writing for magazines . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article for a blog , but print and digital are different and have different needs . <p> Do magazines even exist anymore ? The issue with this articles is that its about old media that does n't  apply to most anymore . There are n't  any length restriction in the digital age . If you 're writing for magazines or newspapers , you 're not going to have a job for much longer . This is old school information that does n't  apply today . <p> Wow , another smug millennial who thinks the world revolves around him . Yes , magazines still exist . No , your comment was n't cute or funny . Your career advice is sophomoric at best . Just because publisher word count may not apply to you does n't  mean it does n't  apply to everyone . <p> I 've never heard of publishers word count before this , and I have been a freelance writer for five years . This must not be something that is used much these days . I think I may ask about it in the future just to see if it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never run across word count counted this way . <p> I 've never heard this and I 've been writing on the Internet for several years . This is the first time Ive ever heard anything like this . It does n't  seem like it would be real to me . Why would a publisher pay more than they had to for the same writing ? <p> I 've had publishers off this to me . Its a real thing . Its not all publishers . It is mainly print publishers , not Internet publishers . If you write for print magazines , many publishers will offer you this option . <p> Wouldnt it be easier for everyone if there was a standard way to calculate word count rather than it be different for every publication ? Why do people always want to make things more difficult than they have to be ? <p> Different magazines have different word count needs . The standard is counting the exact number of words which is fine for online , but as the article says , causes issues for print magazines and newspapers . That 's why a Publishers word count exists . 
@@12747217 @1347217/ <h> What is the Best Business Proposal Font ? <p> Successful business proposals require a huge amount of effort . They may involve the collaboration of several different parties . Business proposals require facts and figures which are backed by solid research . Their tone is formal and content needs to promote the objectives contained therein . A business proposal must look and feel attractive . The golden rule to remember is " first impressions count . " <p> Its a great pity that many otherwise fantastic business proposals fall flat . A common theme apparent in the vast majority of rejections is based on the golden rule . The authors of these failed proposals did not make first impressions count , at least not in their favor . And one of the questions that probably was never asked that may have helped was , " What is the best font for a business proposal ? " <p> While the choice of font may seem inconsequential , it does in fact play a very important role . On a sub-conscious level , font tells the reader more about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider typical outdoor signage used by a nursery school . The letters are large , simple , bold and contain an assortment of bright colors . Tots and toddlers play school . They give the impression of fun . <p> Signage outside a lawyers office would be noticeably different . The choice of color would be uniform throughout , while the font itself would be smaller . It would imply that this is a business environment . Do not expect to find unicorns dancing on any rainbows here . J S Shark and associates . Attorneys at law . <p> It should be evident that the font used in a proposal will be very different from that used in nursery school signage . The subliminal message should be clear ; this proposal is serious . It means a lot , has been well-researched and contains information of value . It was not banged together using a sloppy approach . It should speak for itself . It needs to say , " I am important . Read me in my entirety . Pay attention to my content . It may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its clientele . " So what is the best font for a business proposal ? <p> Before answering that question , it is important to distinguish between the different types of fonts . There are literally thousands of fonts available . Some are free , others not . Some fonts are exclusive . They are used to establish or entrench a corporate identity . An example here is the Coca Cola font with its famous curling ribbon . <p> Fonts such as these may have patents or legal clauses ( similar to logos ) which prevent their commercial use by unauthorized 3rd parties . Some fonts are all in upper case , - and others in italics only . All of these can be classed into two separate categories . Serif and sans-serif . <p> Serif fonts , such as Times New Roman , have small " feet " at the bottom of certain letters . A further characteristic particular to a serif font is the " curly bits " found at the top and bottom of certain letters . These " frills " cause the eye to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easier to read when they are printed into document format . <p> If the proposal is going to be submitted as an actual document i.e. , printed and not as an electronic submission , then the body of the proposal should comprise of a single serif font used throughout . I tend to stick with what works well . For me , that is Times New Roman . For headings I generally go with a sans-serif font like Verdana or Helvetica . On the rare occasion when I require a large heading which will stand out above the others , then Arial Black is the way to go . <p> Fonts which are sans-serif do not have the " frilly bits . " They include examples such as Arial Black and Verdana , neither of which has letters with feet or curly bits . These fonts were mostly used to distinguish paragraph headings from the main body of text . With the arrival of electronic communication , it was noted that sans-serif fonts are easier to read on computer screens than the serif versions . With some screens set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with serif fonts tend to make the font look blurry or out of focus . This would reflect poorly on your proposal . <p> If your proposal is going to be submitted electronically , then the body of the proposal should comprise of a single sans-serif font , to be used throughout . Verdana or Helvetica are excellent choices for the digital layout and are making their socially acceptable appearance in some printed formats too . <p> Headings or the introduction of new ideas should differ from the main body of text . Most people agree that a simple Arial Black or Verdana as a font for headings will give your proposal a clean and professional look . Avoid " loud " fonts such as Goudy Stout . Also avoid " hand-written " fonts or fonts that are childish or too " busy . " By busy , I mean overly elaborate fonts which contain elements of advanced calligraphy . <p> Again , choose only one font for headings and stick to it throughout . Having different headings in different fonts , using various sizes and colors , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  do it ; just do n't  ! Your proposal will end up looking like a ransom note from a cheesy B grade movie , rather than the slick and professional business proposal you need to deliver . <h> 34 comments <p> I think most people will ignore this advice because they will assume that a font really does n't  matter when you are writing this proposal . This would be a huge mistake on their part . As a person who looks at many business proposals each day , one that is written in a font that is easy to read makes a huge difference . If you are going to spend days putting together a proposal , it makes sense to take 15 min. to make sure you have the right font to make it as good as it can be . <p> As long as you use a standard font and do n't  try to get all cutesy , you should be fine when writing a business proposal . Its when you start think of using weird or unusual fonts that you 're going to get yourself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman are two of the most widely used fonts . They look professional and are easy readable . Those characteristics are two of the most important aspects when you choose a font for business . <p> I never thought about the font I used before reading this article . I always use the default font , but maybe I should reconsider that . Its hard for me to believe a font would make that much of a difference if a standard one is used . I can see how a strange or weird font could cause issues , but not a standard one . <p> Its surprising how many people try to make business presentations " fancy " by using an unorthodox font . it actually has the complete opposite effect and makes the proposal unprofessional looking . When in doubt , always go with standard fonts . Correction : ALWAYS opt for standard fonts . <p> This really does happen far too often . I do n't  know why people think that fancy font will make their presentation better because it never does . All it does is distract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its difficult to read the font , and most fancy fonts are difficult to read . Use a font that is readily recognizable by everybody and easy to read and you 'll be far ahead of the game . <p> Font of a sign can really mean a lot to the business . I love the examples you give and how they are on the different end of the spectrum . Definitely want a font and font color that best represents the business yet eye catching at the same time . <p> It may seem like overkill until your business proposal fails because it was difficult to read , or looked too " Cutesy " Details are important and the more you can make flawless , the better chance at success you have . Sure , font is n't as important as the content of the proposal , but it can still keep you from having the proposal approved . <p> Thank you for this . I 'm always looking for little edges when I create a business proposal and this is exactly the sort of thing I love to find . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always strive to do . <p> I need to know exactly what is the best font for a business proposal . This gives me ideas , but it does n't  tell me the exact font I should use . How do I know the exact font so I can create a great business proposal that everybody will love ? <p> The best font will depend a bit on your specific proposal . If everyone used the exact same font for all their business proposals and business writing , it would no longer be the best . Variety is important as well . You cant have someone spoon feed you the answer . You have to use some of your own brain to pick the correct one for your proposal . <p> Well , fonts do matter . You need to ensure it is easy to read and also looks neat . In my opinion using basic fonts will be much better than trying to impress with fancy fonts that might be difficult to understand in the end . Its always better to err on simple than to go overboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with the basics . If you do n't  know a lot about fonts , the last thing you want to do is experiment using some funky style . There is nothing that will make you stand out more as an amateur than to use a font that you think is stylistic when you do n't  know anything about fonts . These that to the experts . If you have to choose a font , choose a default font . <p> Did you even read the article ? I think you might want to do that before asking the question again since it does answer what you asked . Granted , it does n't  say specifically which font exactly is best for business proposals , but it does tell you the type that you should be looking at . If you have to ask this question , though with a standard font . <p> FONT CHOICE IS HUGE , and I cant believe there are people out there doing business proposals without considering their font and delivery style ( digital or printed ) . <p> As for the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baskerville is the most believable and least objectionable font . As a serif font , however , one needs to consider its use if the proposal is to be submitted digitally , as it MAY create a slightly more difficult read . <p> Come on , let 's be real here . Font choice really does n't  matter all that much in the entire scheme of a business proposal . I guess if you are type A and need everything to be perfect , let your anal hyperactive needs shine through , but for most of us , the font is n't something that should be of much concern . Definitely not a top one . The actual proposal is much more important ! <p> Do people actually spend time thinking about things like this ? If you 're writing a business proposal , who takes the time to think about the font that is being used ? Most people just tried to get the business proposal done . I do n't  know anybody who uses a font other than the default one that they happen to be writing in when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and over the top anal . If you 're this worried about your business proposal being perfect , you 're likely to much of a perfectionist to actually get up business proposal approved . <p> Small details can sometimes make you stand out . It shows that you take your business proposal seriously and have spent time considering all aspects of it . This may not be as important as the business proposal itself , but it can show your commitment to detail when giving one . <p> In addition to choosing the proper business fonts , can I also point out that there is no need for excessive color . It amazes me how many times people color the font when its not necessary . It does n't  make it stand out . It makes it harder to read . Stick with standard black for business proposals and do n't  try and get fancy with color . <p> I cant agree with this more . It does n't  happen very often , but when it does its just cringe worthy . I 've seen business proposals come in pink which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coloring your proposal in an attempt to make it stand out , you do n't  have a very good proposal in front of you . A good business proposal will stand on its own merits . <p> What is the proper font size to use for business proposal ? Should it be a standard 12 point or is it okay to vary it to what you like ? I personally like 14 point and was wondering if it was okay to use that in my business proposal instead of 12 point . I would love to hear any opinions from those who review business proposals as to the best way to proceed . <p> 12 point font is typical . I would n't make it any smaller . 14 point might be OK , but you want to be careful . If you have any doubts , ask the person you will be giving the proposal to if they have a preference . That 's the safest way to approach it . <p> Just make it readable , people . Seriously , you 'd be amazed at how many proposals come in fonts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposal that difficult read , I 'm not going to read it . I have too many coming across my desk , and my automatic reaction is if the person couldnt take the time to make the business proposal readable , then its likely not going to be very good business proposal . Simple as that . <p> I 've never understood why people try to make things fancier than they need to be . To me , its a sign of desperation that the ideas in the proposal are n't  good enough to stand on their own . If they were , there would be no need to try and make it " prettier " than it needs to be . fancy fonts are nothing more than fluff added to the proposal to try and make it look better than it really is . <p> Does n't  using an unusual font make my business proposal stand out from the rest ? I use unusual fonts so my proposals are remembered and stand out when managers look at them . I also use different colored paper for the same reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing is for a proposal to not get noticed . <p> NO ! ! ! It makes you look desperate and actually takes away from the proposal . You want the proposal to stand on its own two feet without any gimmicks to stand out . If you have to rely on gimmicks , then you proposal is n't strong enough and you need to rework it . <p> There are far more important things to worry about than font when putting a business proposal together . If you are so anal that you must figure out the perfect font , you 're likely too anal to actually turn the business proposal into reality . <p> What about business documents in general ? Are there different fonts that are best for the different type of business documents that are shared among co-workers or is it the same for all business documents ?

@@12747221 @1347221/ <h> Tag : how many sentences <p> There 's often a lot of confusion , but if you 're looking for a general answer to the question , " How many sentences in a paragraph ? " the answer is there are 3 to 8 sentences in a paragraph . The important key to take away from this answer is that its a rule-of-thumb . If you 're looking for a hard and fast rule , you 're out of luck . A paragraph can consist of a single sentence , and since a single word can be a sentence , you can literally have a paragraph that consists of a single word . Of course , if someone asks you to write a paragraph , they wont be altogether happy with that , so how much should you write ? <h> What do teachers want to see in a paragraph ? <p> If you 're a student , your teacher or tutor may ask you to write a paragraph without telling you just how long he or she expects it to be . In general , educators like to see a paragraph consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expresses an idea . Use the next 3 sentences for providing information that supports that idea , and use the final sentence to draw a conclusion . <p> Why do teachers expect longer paragraphs ? Obviously , they want to see that you have acquired knowledge and can think critically . That 's quite difficult- to demonstrate with a single sentence ! Teachers will sometimes set a rule that all paragraphs should be a certain length , but its important to remember that specific paragraph lengths are n't  a prerequisite for acceptable writing . <h> When do you use shorter paragraphs ? <p> Open just about any book , and you 'll find plenty of short paragraphs . If direct speech is used , therell be a new paragraph every time a new speaker starts to talk . News writers also like using short paragraphs . They have to present information in a succinct way and hold the readers attention . <p> Commercial writers know that most people do n't  want to read 1,000 words of closely-spaced text in order to see what they are writing about , so they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use lots of sub-headers so you can see what each paragraph is about before you read it . <h> How do I know when to start a new paragraph ? <p> Every time you begin- to discuss a new thought that contributes to the overarching theme of your work , you can start- a new paragraph . A paragraph will usually consist of a collection of sentences that , when considered as a group , have something in common . As soon as you move on to the next idea , you can begin a new paragraph . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to agonise about it too much , because as I 've pointed out , there are no specific rules . <h> Tips for writing strong paragraphs <p> Its best to begin a paragraph with a sentence that defines the topic that will be discussed . Try to keep it fairly simple . If you include too many ideas in your opening sentence , you run the risk of getting tangled in an overly complex and incoherent paragraph . Every sentence in a paragraph should support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing a new or related topic , start a new paragraph . <p> The University of North Carolina helps students with paragraph construction by providing them with a 5-step process : <p> Express the idea that the paragraph will cover in a topic sentence . <p> Explain the idea . <p> Use an example . <p> Explain why the example relates to the idea . <p> Draw a conclusion . <p> Obviously , the recipe has been designed for those who want to write an informative and convincing work . And because these rules are n't  really cast in stone , you 'll find that different institutions give different recommendations . <h> The debate continues <p> If we look around , well find that the idea of paragraphs with a minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common . But there are some who say that two to three paragraphs per page are best and others who say that 5 to 7 lines will do the job . Meanwhile , journalism students are taught to keep sentences as short as possible , and one sentence paragraphs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that using more than one paragraph to discuss an idea is perfectly alright , and since there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs , I cant really contradict them . I even found one recommendation that suggested a minimum of 7-10 sentences per paragraph and a maximum of a full page ! <h> How long should your paragraphs be ? <p> Unless you 're busy with academic writing , the length of your paragraphs is up to you . I like shorter paragraphs for informal writing such as this blog post . I like the idea of sticking to one idea per paragraph , and I think that paragraphs make reading and understanding a text a whole lot simpler . Single-sentence paragraphs are great for emphasis . <p> If you are writing to pass a school , college or university course , I recommend you ask your teacher or professor what 's expected of you . Its always better to ask in these situations than to try to guess . This is by far the best way to make sure you tailor your writing to what your teacher expects rather than by going by a general rule .

For those looking for a general answer to the question , " How many pages are there in the bible ? " the answer would be " The average bible has around 1,200 pages . " This is a general approximation and there are a lot of factors which can make the number of pages of a particular bible be much less or much more than this number . Anyone seeking a definitive answer to the question of the number of pages in the bible needs to realize that a combination of variables can come into play . <h> What books of the bible have been included ? <p> If one were to take a look at the Catholic bible , for example , the additional books of the Apocrypha ( religious texts not found in most bibles ) would have to be included . The Apocrypha alone would add a substantial number of pages when compared to a standard bible , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the Apocrypha , they are at least comprised of both the New and Old testaments . Unfortunately , the rule does not apply to The Living Bible . This version of the bible only includes the New Testament . A bible of this nature would end up having far fewer pages . Since different bible editions include different writings , each edition differs in the number of pages it has . <h> The format of the bible <p> Bibles with no pages are more common than you think . In some circles , bibles with no pages are quite the rage . Electronic or digital versions of the bible , without any physical pages , can be easily acquired be being downloaded from the internet or shared via memory cards , CDs etc . <p> But there are other factors that influence the number of pages found in any bible . Font , spacing , page width and height ; margins and other print related issues would most certainly cause variation in the number of pages in a bible ( and why most teachers make assignments by word count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typed in bold and with double spacing would obviously require more pages . The opposite approach , using a small font with single spacing , would require fewer pages . The exact same bible with the exact same number of words will often have a different number of pages depending on how the publisher took these into account . <h> The specific version of the bible <p> Certain languages and translations will also impact on how many pages there are in the bible . Great discrepancies can occur even among similar versions . The King James Version of the bible may have more pages than the Revised Standard Version or the New American Standard Version . <p> Because the number of pages in different bibles varies so dramatically , the name of the book in the bible being referenced , the chapter and verse number help us to be " on the same page " when discussing a biblical text . Biblical scholars realized that different versions and translations of the bible could impede research . Page 20 of my King James Version may be completely different to page 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . <p> By slicing the bible into chunks , research can be more accurate . In fact , you can go to an exact phrase in the bible . Its a system applauded by scholars . <h> On average , how many pages are in the bible ? <p> If you took a run of the mill , everyday bible , and you managed to count all the pages , you would have the following : <p> The Old Testament has 929 chapters . It has 23,214 verses which comprise roughly 622,700 words . The New Testament consists of 260 chapters , divided into 7,959 verses or roughly 184,600 words . This would give our typical bible 1,189 chapters . These are made up of 31,173 verses and using a rough word count , this amounts to 807,370 words , although the King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> Using a standard font , the average bible has around 1,200 pages . As a book , the bible is as thick as " The Lord of the Rings " and similar fantasy novel epics . The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used for spiritual guidance . And that , I believe , is the best answer you will ever get to this question . <p> This- is a question we get from time to time . There are instances- when you 're given an assignment , not by word count , but assigned by the number of pages . For example , " Write a paper four pages long . " If you get an assignment to write four pages , one of the first questions that will likely come to mind is , " How many words are in four pages ? " If you need to figure out words per page , you can use a words per page calculator . <p> The truth is there is no definitive answer to this question . The number of words it will take to fill a page will depend on a number of factors including the type of font used , the font size , spacing elements , the margins used on the paper , the paragraph length , etc . For example , if the assignment says the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater number of words to fill a page than if the assignment requires a 12-point font . <p> For those who need a general rule of thumb , a typical page which has 1-inch margins and is typed in 12 point font with standard spacing elements will be approximately 500 words when typed single spaced . For assignments that require double spacing , it would take approximately 250 words to fill the page . For an assignment that requires you to write four pages , you can make the estimation that you 'll need to write approximately 2000 words for a single spaced paper , or 1000 words if the assignment is double spaced . Again , the type of font used can make the word count higher or lower , but its a good rule of thumb for those who are simply looking for a general estimation . <p> Since there can be a large variation on the number of words needed to fill a page , most papers are no longer assigned by page count . They are instead assigned by word count . That is , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 2000 words rather than 3 4 pages . This way it is much more difficult for the writer to " game the system " by using large fonts and excessive spacing to meet the writing criteria . <p> If you are given a writing assignment with a page number , the best thing to do is go directly to the person who made the assignment and ask for a word count . This will take away all the variations and help ensure your writing assignment meets expectations . If its for something informal and you simply need a general guideline , you can find it below . <h> How many pages is <p> The below list is an approximation , and actual pages will differ depending on a number of factors mentioned earlier in this article .

Using this definition , " He is at a big park . " would be three and one-third words ( including the period ) .

@@12747226 @1347226/ <h> 12 Things NOT to Include in a Query Letter <p> If you want to be published in a magazine or by a traditional book publisher , the chances are that you 'll have to submit a query letter at some point . At its most basic , a query letter is simply a letter that details your project and your writing credentials to a prospective editor , agent , or publisher . Yet the query letter is a source of great angst for writers because it is often the only piece of information that a gatekeeper will see before either rejecting your work or asking to see more . When one piece of paper controls that much of your destiny , the pressure to get it right is enormous . Its the first step on your way to getting to submit your work . <p> Tons of books and online resources exist to help you write the perfect letter . However , in addition to the things that you should do , there are plenty of things you need to avoid , as well . Here are twelve things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast rejection is your goal . <h> Mistakes <p> This is the first contact that an editor or agent has with your work . If its riddled with typos and grammatical errors , they are n't  going to take a chance on anything more from you because you 've already demonstrated that you are not capable of submitting error-free work . Proofread , rewrite , and polish that letter until its perfect , and then have someone else ( or several someones ) read it , too , to make certain that you 're not overlooking something . You want your letter to show you as a competent , careful writer , not as someone who dashes off stuff and submits it without a care . You always want to be improving your writing skills . <h> Gifts or bribes <p> Writers will sometimes include items like tickets to shows , homemade items , or even money in an effort to get an agent or editor to look at their work . This strategy will always fail . First , its unethical for an editor or agent to accept any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift and swore that it did n't  influence their decision about your work , the perception would be there , should word of the transaction get out . ( And publishing is a small world , so word would get out ! ) A reputable agent or publishing house would not risk their reputation by accepting any sort of " gift . " Second , since they are n't  accepting it , it becomes something for them to deal with , either by returning it to you or throwing it away . See number 9 , below , for more about why agents and editors do n't  want extra " stuff . " <h> Anything that reveals your stalker tendencies <p> Its recommended that you mention in your letter where you heard about the agent or editor , or any personal contact you may have had , such as a meeting at a conference . What is n't recommended is that you mention that you know the person has three kids , that they go to such-and-such church , and that you know that their family went to Barbados last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on Facebook , keep your findings to yourself . Keep any mention of what you know about the agent or editor to the professional realm , only . <h> Arrogance <p> Yes , you should give the agent or editor some clue about where your work fits into the marketplace . If its similar to a certain successful work , or if it combines elements from two or more successful works , its okay to mention that briefly . What 's not okay is to talk about how your book will be the next bestseller , how it will outsell anything by J.K. Rowling , or how it will make millions for you and anyone lucky enough to publish your work . Keep it real , please . If you 're this arrogant and unrealistic in the query letter , the agent or editor is already thinking that working with you will be too much trouble . <h> " Over the top " language <p> You want to avoid all " over the top " language , cuteness , rudeness , or crudeness just to get attention . Your book or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a unique voice and you want that to show through in your letter . A little of this can be fine if it is truly needed to represent your work and if it is handled well . But when you resort to this type of language and/or style in an effort to shock or get attention , it will fail . If your whole letter is nothing but F-bombs , baby talk , or crude jokes with no purpose , expect to be rejected . <h> Your age/photo <p> You want your work to be judged on its own merits . That means removing yourself from the equation as much as possible . You do n't  want an agent or editor to know how old you are or what you look like until they are so captivated by your work that age and looks do n't  matter . Most gatekeepers will disavow that age or looks sway their decision but bias , even if unintentional , can play a role . Its somewhat true in our visual world that younger , better-looking , TV-worthy authors are in demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would look on TV , on a book jacket , at appearances , or in a book trailer that may sway their decisions . Send only your work and do n't  include any mention of your age or a photo that you think would be " perfect " on your book jacket . <h> Anything not relevant <p> When you talk about yourself and your credentials in your query letter , only mention credits and accomplishments that are relevant to the work in question . Do n't  include the fact that you won your 8th-grade writing contest . Do n't  list your work history unless your work is relevant to the book or article . Do n't  mention your hobbies , favorite foods , movies , or books , either . Agents and editors do not care that you love Twinkies and Pretty Woman . They only care about the project you are pitching . <h> Bizarre fonts , papers , and formatting <p> You think you 're making your submission stand out by submitting it in a 14-point calligraphy font on hot pink paper . The agent or editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the accepted conventions . <h> Anything not requested <p> Agents and editors are drowning in paper . The last thing they need from you is anything that they did not specifically request . This means no complete manuscripts or even chapters , no copies of your self-published book , no resumes , no cute drawings that would make " perfect " cover art , a DVD of your ideal book trailer , and no head shots . You may think you 're saving the agent time by making all of this available to them , but they only see more crap they have to dispose of or send back to you . Only submit what is requested . If an agent or editor wants more , theyll ask for it . <h> Multiple projects <p> A query letter should be for one article or book . Do n't  submit one letter that covers the three manuscripts you 've got stuffed in a drawer , or the fifteen articles you 've got on your hard drive . One letter = one project . Always . <h> Incomplete projects <p> Only query a finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ready to write if given the go-ahead by an editor . No editor wants to read a fantastic query letter only to hear the writer say , " Great . I can have the completed manuscript to you in three months . Maybe four . " You 're not querying a half-baked idea here , or a book of which youve only written the first three chapters . You 're not feeling an editor out on whether or not you should continue with the work . You 're querying something which is complete and ready to go , or you need to wait until it is . <h> Anything personal about you <p> I 've already mentioned that you should n't include a photo or mention anything irrelevant in your query letter , but you should refrain from mentioning any other personal information , as well . You may think you 're " bonding " with the agent if you tell him or her that you have three dogs or that you volunteer at a hospice . You may think you 're gaining a sympathy vote if you mention your spouses recent death and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disabled . Agents and editors are n't  cold , unfeeling people , but the bottom line is that they do not need to know these things about you . Mentioning things like hobbies or pets only takes up valuable space in a letter that needs to be as brief as possible . Worse , mentioning things like disabilities or tragedies brings up the bias argument again and a gatekeeper will likely steer clear to avoid the perception that their decision was somehow influenced by your tragedy . Talk only about your project and leave out anything personal . <p> A query letter is a professional introduction of your work to an agent or editor . As such , it needs to be kept professional in both tone and appearance . It is not a place to showcase your " creativity " or lifestyle choices . Its not a place to expound upon your literary greatness or to discuss all the things that you and the agent have in common . Since it should n't be longer than one page , typed , single spaced , and in 12-point font , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make every sentence count and do n't  waste them on things that are not relevant or which may actually hurt your chances . 
@@12747227 @1347227/ <h> Tag : write a novel <p> How long is a piece of string ? How tall is a tree ? As we so often find , there is no single answer to certain questions , and the question of how long it takes to write a book is one of these . There are so many variables that come into play it would be difficult to enumerate them all , but generally speaking , the volume of text , the complexity of the subject matter and the amount of time a writer can actually devote to his or her writing are among the factors that would influence the answer . For those looking for the most rudimentary of guidelines , it takes a year to write a book . Now that has been written , its also important to point out that the year-to-book timeline does n't  really apply to anything more than a framework to get some writers started . <h> Some of the quickest books to write <p> E-books : The fastest Ive ever written an e-book from beginning to end was just one week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bit short if the book were to be printed for an adult reading audience ; but for an e-book , it was relatively substantial . The topic required quite a lot of research , so if I 'd picked a subject that was a little less factual than " How to train for a marathon , " I estimate I could have finished even faster . <p> Heavily illustrated books : Kids books for a very young reading audience and coffee table books that consist mainly of images can be even quicker to write . I 've knocked off a kids story in less than an hour , and just captioning images does n't  take long when eye-candy is the principal selling point of a book . That does n't  mean the book will be ready in that amount of time . Since these books are n't  primarily about writing , the writing is the easiest and quickest part of the process . The other aspects ( photography , illustrations ) will take much longer . <p> Recipe books : It does n't  take long to write a recipe book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing your recipes and taking photographs of your mouth-watering results into account , it can turn into quite a lengthy project .

In general , I manage a word count of about 4,000 words on a writing a day provided I have direction and know what comes next . I edit on the following day , and that takes anything from half the day to the whole day , depending on my form when I drafted the original text , my mood , and whether I 'm feeling self-confident on the day . That brings down the final number to about 2,000 words a day when averaging it out . <p> If you 're really writing something that means a lot to you , completing your book could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the focus of her autobiographical work when she was already halfway through writing it .

One publisher was kind enough to tell her what he thought needed changing , and she 's been reworking the whole thing by fits and starts ever since . <p> Even non-fiction works can take ages to compile . Edward Gibbons " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire " took 20 years to complete , but it is still considered to be the definitive work on Roman history . Meanwhile , " The Cantos " by Ezra Pound took a massive 52 years to write , and he would probably still be writing it if he were still alive .

If you 're serious about writing a book and getting it published before you depart from this mortal coil , I 'd advise you to get started now . Create a framework to guide you through the chapters you have to write , and set mini-deadlines for yourself so that you 're forced to keep working at it . If you receive rejection letters , see if you can distil any valuable information from them . Then go back to your book and see if you can accommodate the ideas you 've been given without completely deconstructing your story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the kind publisher who actually took the trouble of reading your proof and commenting on it , the greater your chance of getting it published . <p> You have decided you want to write a book in the next year . That 's great , but now you need to come up with a plan to make that happen that 's simple enough to help you reach the goal , yet allows you to write enough to complete a book within a year . One easy and effective way to accomplish the book-in-a-year goal is to take the 365-day book writing challenge . <p> The concept of this challenge is simple enough that any writer , no matter what their level , should be able to follow it to reach their goal . Most people who decide they want to write a book fail because they try to do too much in too little amount of time . This challenge leverages the fact there are 365 days in a year and that you want to build a daily writing habit . <p> The book writing challenge works in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to write between one and 365 words . You want to shoot for writing the highest number of words you can to cross the highest number off the chart , but as long as you write any number of words which corresponds with a number that 's still available on the chart , you 're golden . At the end of the day , you place an " x " on the chart over the number of words you wrote that day . Each day you do this for the entire year and at the end , you will have written 66,795 words . Even more importantly , you 'll have established a daily writing habit which you can then use to write your next book in even less time . <h> 365 Day Book Writing Challenge ( click on image to print PDF ) <p> To be successful in this challenge , there are a few important steps you should take . First , you should print out the challenge sheet . Once done , you should put it somewhere where you 'll see it daily . Tape it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin board above your writing desk . The chart needs to be visible so you are reminded each day you need to write , even if its only a little bit . This visual reminder will help you reach your daily goal of writing and the ultimate goal of finishing your book . <p> The second rule is you are n't  allowed to go to bed until you have crossed off one of the numbers on the sheet . There really is no excuse not to cross off one of the numbers . The truth is that if you are unable to cross off a number each day of the year with all of the smaller word counts available , you 're not serious about writing the book . In a way , its a test to determine if you are willing to take the actions necessary to write the book , or if you just say you want to , but its only words . That may sound a bit harsh , but if you cant write a few words each day- no matter what happens in life , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that can keep you from completing this challenge is yourself . <p> Another key about this challenge which increases your likelihood of success is that it takes into account the reality of life . There are going to be busy days and days when the unexpected happens and you wont be able to write as much as you hoped . You should always shoot for the highest word count number still available on the sheet , but when a day comes when that is n't possible , crossing off a smaller number is perfectly acceptable . <p> While having a book written at the end of the year is a huge deal , the biggest benefit of this challenge is something you 'll gain that 's far more important . This challenge requires you to write every day . Even the days when you 're only able to write a word or two , you must sit down and write something . That daily writing will turn into a daily routine by the end of the year . Once you have established that habit , you have created a foundation which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you have had the goal to write a book in the past but have failed in getting it done , I encourage you to try the 365-day book writing challenge . It has a lot of things going for it that other challenges do n't  , which increases the likelihood you 'll actually complete it and reach your goal . Best of all , at the end of the year , you 'll have a book written and you 'll have the skill-set in place to write as many more as you want to in the future .

@@12747229 @1347229/ <h> Tag : writing level <p> One of the tracking features Word Counter provides in the " Details " section on the right side of the tool is a Reading Level . Of all the metrics the tool keeps track of , this is probably the one we receive the most questions about . With that in mind , we felt it would be beneficial to try to- explain in a little bit more detail how this metric works and what exactly it means . <p> First and foremost , Reading Level is n't a reflection of your writing skill in any way . You may have excellent writing which ranks at a fourth-grade reading level , while you may have substandard writing which ranks at the college reading level . There seems to be an assumption by many that a higher Reading Level rank means the writing is better . That is , a Reading Level at a college level is better writing than a Reading Level at a tenth-grade level . This is not what this metric is measuring . <p> The only thing the Reading Level tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person would need to have- in order to understand the words you 're using in your writing . Its not meant to be a ranking of your writing ability in any way . Its simply a general guideline so you can anticipate what education level a person would need to have- to understand what you have written . <p> WordCounter assesses Reading Level by using the Dale " Chall readability formula . This formula uses 3,000 common words a fourth grader should understand as its foundation . Basically , if you use only the words found in the list of 3,000 words when you write , your Reading Level rank will be at a fourth-grade level . As you use more words which are not on the list of 3,000 words , the Reading Level will increase . The more words you use that fall outside the core 3,000-word list , the higher level of reading the Reading Level feature will assign to your writing . <p> When you first begin to type in the text area , Reading Level will display as N/A . In order for a Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of two sentences . The number of sentences is part of the formula used , and the more sentences in the writing , the more accurate the Readability Level will be . There 's a need for a two-sentence minimum to begin to make an accurate Reading Level determination . <p> With this in mind , when the metric shows your writing at " college level , " what its saying is that you 're using a significant number of words in your writing which a fourth grader wont be familiar with . If the Reading Level says fourth-grade level , then a fourth-grader would understand the vast majority of the words you used in your writing . If the metric says a seventh-grade level , you 're using some words that a typical fourth-grader would n't understand , but not as many as would be in the writing to rank the Reading Level at the college level . <p> Reading Level may be important for a number of reasons .

@@12747230 @1347230/ <h> Does Donald Trump Really Speak at a Fourth Grade Level ? <p> There were a number of articles that made the claim that Donald Trump spoke at a fourth grade level . They made this determination by running the different candidates presidential announcement speeches through the Flesch " Kincaid readability test . The problem with using a prepared speech is that there 's a good chance that a speech is n't how the candidates actually talk . There 's even a good chance the speech was written by a speech writer instead of the candidate . A better way to determine the speaking level of the candidates would be to analyze them talking in a non-speech setting . <p> It should be noted there are some limitations to the speaking level designations found below . The Dale " Chall readability formula gives a general approximation to the candidates speaking level , but it is n't conclusive .

" <p> We always knew Mandela was old when he passed away , but nobody knew he was 800 years old , and he had an affinity for collecting sex toys . The insertion of the Oxford comma would have kept many people from taking a double-take when reading that sentence . <p> There are those who hate the Oxford comma . The AP style guide says that the serial comma or Oxford comma is wrong . Other style guides say that its OK and that it can eliminate confusion as to your meaning . Generally speaking , there is no right or wrong answer to this question . While some people get quite passionate about arguing for or against this little punctuation mark coming before a conjunction , its not worth getting worked up about either way in most situations . What 's important to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 3 comments <p> I understand why its needed from this article , but it still looks strange when I see it . I guess I was one of those who was taught to never use the Oxford Comma so it looks strange every time I see it . <p> I think it was just the change over generations . I know when I was in school they taught not to use a comma before the and , but today they teach to put the , before the and . Things change and this seems to be one of those things . 
@@12747232 @1347232/ <h> Month : January 2017 <p> Love has been described as " A Many Splendored Thing " in poems ( William Waterway ) , in films ( 1955 ) , and in Academy Award winning songs ( lyrics Paul Francis Webster ) . The same descriptive phrase has been used for a TV soap opera . <p> " A Many Splendored Thing " originated in a poem by late 19th century poet , Francis Thompson . He was English , so he probably included a " u " in " splendoured " when he coined the phrase in The Hound of Heaven as he spent 182 lines investigating Christianity and Gods search for a missing soul . This would , of course , be 182 lines of words describing the concept of divine love . However , the phrase that has outlived him is n't really a conclusive description . Its rather a cop-out . <p> In the 1970 movie " Love Story " Erich Segal used the phrase " Love means never having to say you 're sorry , " and at about the same time in our history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines of a girl and boy , and sugar sweet " Love Is " statements . <h> The Search for the Best Words for Love <p> People have been looking for the best words to describe love for years , centuries , and perhaps for millennia . Perhaps they have been searching since the days when cavemen began grabbing cavewomen by the hair before dragging them into the cave as a mark of affection . It would have made sense for them to start considering something other than grunts to describe those feelings they were experiencing . Dragging someone by the hair could be hard work , and grunts could be misunderstood . A cliche or two could save a lot of effort . <p> Fairy tales , poets , Hollywood movies and Internet sites followed centuries later , finding thousands , if not tens of thousands of ways to continue the quest for the best words to describe love . The very fact they kept coming up with new ones indicates its not easy and the best , and most conclusive , description has not yet been found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a definitive answer will have discovered something important . It might have more impact than any other scientific discoveries which have earned experts Nobel Prizes over the years . This could happen because it would influence peoples everyday lives and relationships in a way that could change the world . At least then people might have a real reference point when trying to explain love . <p> As the situation stands now , there are no words , best or otherwise , that will describe love in a way that will satisfy everyone . There is n't a phrase that will give everyone a lightbulb moment and a reason to respond , " That 's it ! Now I know what love is . Now I can love , be loved and , maybe , be in love . " <h> Parts of Many Speeches <p> Its no wonder its so difficult . The word " love " forms parts of many types of speech . It can be a noun ( or naming word ) for a series of sensations , feelings and emotions . It is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to experiencing it . In addition , love also functions as a noun modifier in " love affair , " an adjective in " loving relationship " and an adverb in " He looked at her lovingly . " <p> Further complicating the idea of describing love in words is the fact that there are so many different types of love . As if it is n't already impossible to describe the love experience in words , we are expected to find more words , more adjectives , adverbs and other nouns , to attach to that indescribable concept . This will break it down into categories that are more specific , but probably even harder to describe . <h> Adding to the Confusion <p> As a result , the following words , and more , are tossed in : unconditional and conditional , free , passionate , romantic , selfless and self , playful , divine , maternal and paternal , brotherly and sisterly , eternal and endless . Its supposed to help if we add these to the word we find hardest to apply , and almost impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manageable by separating it into smaller categories . <p> The effect it has , however , is to set up a lot more puzzles and challenges . Now we have not only one concept to describe , and to understand , but several . Perhaps once we have come up with the best words to describe unconditional , or even maternal love , we can return to describing romantic love . Then we can hopefully , get closer to understanding the wonderful , scary , passionate and all-consuming experience that is love . It is , indeed , a " many splendored thing " but its also sometimes a many pitfalled thing . It can make you the happiest person around , particularly if you experience it as a verb of doing and experiencing . It can also break your heart if you keep falling in and out of the love noun . <h> Words that Describe Love <p> For those who are simply looking for a list of words that describe love , or make reference to it , here are some of the most popular : <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be in the least bit surprised if I came across National Let 's Eat Takeout Day , and I 'd probably support it if it existed . Earth Day is real enough , but why only one day ? Shouldnt we make every day Earth Day ? Maybe we would n't want to turn off the lights for an hour every night , but perhaps we could turn off the TV , or do something else that 's good for the environment . <p> Now we have National Word Day . Have you never heard about it ? Heres what you need to know ! <h> Why National Word Day ? <p> Have you ever noticed we do n't  use a lot of the words in our vocabulary ? By the time you reach the age of four , you already know 10,000 words . Once you reach adulthood , you 'll probably know 20,000 to 35,000 different words , and you 'll keep learning new ones until you reach middle age ( and possibly even later if you have a curious mind and like to read ) . <p> How many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't find an answer to this question , but I 'm ready to guess we probably use the same 10,000 we knew when we were little , if we even use that many . <p> There are currently 171,476 words in the English language , with more being added every day . I know because I counted them especially for you . Alright , I did n't  . I looked that up . <p> According to the same source , a further 47,156 words have become obsolete or archaic . What happened to them ? People stopped using them so they became extinct . When we stop using words , they just die out of the language , and you have to admit that the mass-extinction of words is rather a sad thing . <p> That 's why we have National Word Day . Its a words-conservation drive ! <h> What Should You Do on National Word Day ? <p> We are encouraged to give seldom-used words an airing in the hope that others will pick them up and use them too . National Word Day is a celebration of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversation to the next level , making our speech much more colorful , individual and interesting . <p> If we are able , we are asked to actually immortalize a word . Is it possible ? Yes , it is ! Well see how a little further on . <p> Last , but not least , were asked to read the dictionary until we find a word we did n't  know . We must then memorize that word and immediately put it to use in our speech and in our writing . <h> When Is National Word Day ? <p> In celebration of a poet and playwright who has kept many words that would otherwise have become obsolete alive , National Word Day is celebrated on the Ides of March . That 's the 15th of March , the day when Caesar is believed to have been assassinated . This day was immortalized by Shakespeare , keeping the word " Ides " alive , even though its usually only used when we read Shakespeares play . <p> On the Ides of March , you get your chance to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will choose ! I think I will go for " rabelaisian , " a word I so seldom use that I had forgotten how to spell it and had to look it up . I like it because it rolls off the tongue nicely , and because it refers to bold , coarse , robust humor which I generally keep out of this blog , but I still enjoy . I would be quite sad if that word died out . <h> Who Started National Word Day ? <p> I just did ! And if I may say so , I 've got it off to a good start with this blog post . Who gave me the right to do this ? Well , its a free country is n't it ? You do n't  think I have enough credibility to start a special day all on my own ? I probably do n't  , but you 're going to help me , are n't  you ? What 's in it for you ? Absolutely nothing ! I wont even promise you my eternal gratitude for your contribution . <p> Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , people will think they 're crazy . If two people celebrate it , people will think its a conspiracy , but if you can get three people celebrating the day , people might just think its a movement , and join in . Well , that 's my theory anyway . <p> Whos up for joining me in the celebration ? Youd better start preparing now . Its like Christmas shopping . If you wait too long , all the best words will be taken . Which one will you choose ? Make your pledge now , and do n't  forget to invite your friends ! <p> This seemingly idle question may not be all that simple to answer . One thing is sure , 1,000 words all written without any paragraph spacing will drive your reader a little mad . The first point is clear : 1,000 words is a lot of words . Split it up into paragraphs for heavens sake , or expect your intended readers to head for the hills for a chance to rest their weary eyes on some open space . <p> So given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eyes , you know you have to split it into paragraphs . How do you do that ? <h> A Sentence Is an Idea , a Paragraph Is Closely Related Ideas <p> Whatever you 're discussing , you 'll discover a number of concepts which you presumably planned before you started writing . To make it all hang together nicely , you add a bit of space when you transition from one area of discussion to another . As with any rule , there are exceptions , but broadly speaking , essay writing and academic writing calls for paragraphs in the 100-200 word range . <p> Bear in mind that academic and essay writing usually means you 're writing for a fairly dedicated reader , but what about the huge chunk of the population who are frightened off by big chunks of text , even if they are only six or seven lines long ( depending on font ) ? <h> Journalists and Commercial Writers Keep Their Paragraphs Short <p> " White space " is a wonderful illusion that tells your reader what you have to say is pretty easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each paragraph is only one sentence long . I feel that 's taking it to extremes , and it can have the opposite effect of making your writing look disjointed . I like to see at least three or four lines to a paragraph , and as an indication , my longest paragraph so far is just 74 words long . <p> You can assume commercial writing and news reports will have paragraphs approximately half as long as the ones youd see in academic or essay writing . In this case , were looking at ten to twenty paragraphs per 1,000 words instead of five to ten . <h> Dialogues Have a New Paragraph for Every New Speaker <p> One context in which a paragraph can be as short as five characters is direct speech involving two or more speakers . <p> " Oh ! " <p> Count em : two characters for the word , and three for the punctuation marks . To begin with , youd introduce or refer to your speakers , but once the conversation is flowing nicely , you can start skipping them at times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! " John couldnt help being amused at Marys surprise . <p> " You do n't  really mean it , do you ? " <p> " Of course I mean it , silly ! " <p> Its a lot less cumbersome to skip a mention of the speaker than to add " said Mary " and " John said " after every direct quote . So theoretically , you can have a paragraph consisting of one word plus punctuation marks . 1,000 words in direct speech would therefore mean you 'd write way more than the five or ten paragraphs our initial guideline suggested . <h> How Many Paragraphs in 1,000 Words ? <p> here 's a basic summary . <p> Probably not less than 5 paragraphs . <p> For easy reading , probably no less than 10 . <p> For direct speech , one for every time you change speaker ( however many times that is ) . <h> Does It Matter ? <p> Not necessarily , but bear in mind that even teachers who are paid to read students writing get tired eyes . The easier it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely your teacher is to notice those clever details you included . There 's also a distinct possibility they wont start hating you while they read your work . Yes , they 're supposed to be unbiased , but everyone is human ! <p> When writing in other contexts : an article , a blog , or a book , keeping paragraphs short helps to hold your readers attention . Yes , there are famous writers who just wrote without much attention to paragraphs , or even punctuation , but their work is n't an easy read , and no matter how educated we may be , " easy " is invariably the preferred option . <p> To take easy reading to the next level , try using sub-headers every paragraph to three paragraphs . This is applicable to blogs and web pages , and to a certain extent , in academic writing . When you hit a web page for info , what do you do ? I look at the header , and then I scan the sub-heads to get an idea of the writers approach to the subject . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on . But if the sub-headers are interesting , and seem to tell me there 's something worth learning , I 'll read the whole piece . <h> Whatever You Do , Use Paragraphs <p> Using paragraphs well ( with or without sub-heads ) makes your work more accessible to your reader , and , to a certain extent , it shows you 've ordered your thoughts and are discussing one point at a time . If you cant organize your work into paragraphs consisting of related thoughts , you may be jumping around too much . Check it out and try again . <h> How Many Paragraphs is <p> The following list is an approximation for those who are writing essays with the standard 100 200 words per paragraph and 50 to 100 words for blog or article easy reading . The actual number of paragraphs will depend on numerous factors and this is nothing more than a general rough estimate . Below are estimated words to paragraphs conversions : <p> 250 words is 1 to 3 paragraphs for essays , 3 to 5 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 500 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 750 words is 4 to 8 paragraphs for essays , 8 to 15 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1000 words is 5 to 10 paragraphs for essays , 10 to 20 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1500 words is 8 to 15 paragraphs for essays , 15 to 30 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2000 words is 10 to 20 paragraphs for essays , 20 to 40 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2500 words is 13 to 25 paragraphs for essays , 25 to 50 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 3000 words is 15 to 30 paragraphs for essays , 30 to 60 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 4000 words is 20 to 40 paragraphs for essays , 40 to 80 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 5000 words is 25 to 50 paragraphs for essays , 50 to 100 paragraphs for easy writing <p> Symbolism is all around us , and although some symbols are universal , some concepts have symbolic significance that are purely individual . As I 'm sure you 've guessed , words are made up of symbols ( the alphabet ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even your name is symbol that represents your identity ! <p> Words can be symbols all on their own , or they can be combined to create symbolism . So how are words used as symbols ? Here are some examples of specific words as symbols <h> Colors <p> Colors , and the words we use to define them are highly symbolic . <p> " He wore purple . " Purple is associated with royalty and has been since Roman times . Originally , this happened because purple dye was so expensive that only the very wealthy could afford it . In those days , the really wealthy people were aristocrats or monarchs , hence the symbolism of purple for royalty which we still use today . <p> " She was in a black mood . " Black has many symbolic connections . It could represent grief , but in this context it represents anger and negativity . Its rather unfair because black is a perfectly lovely color , but there it is ! <p> " Her intentions were white as the driven snow . " White symbolizes purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , it gets dirty fast ! <p> " When he started to act up , I just saw red ! " Here , red symbolizes anger , but it can also symbolize danger . For example , " When he behaved so badly , it was a big red flag for me . " <h> Miscellaneous Examples <p> Our ability to equate words with associations has led to everything from flowers to times of the day and directions being used as symbols . <p> " She chose the left-hand path . " Being left-handed was once considered sinister . In fact , " sinister " even meant " left " at one time . A person who is interested in the left-hand path is into the occult . As a left-hander , I take exception to that . <p> " It was a downward spiral . " To us , " downward " symbolizes something that is not going well . Personally , I love going downhill , especially on a bicycle , but in other contexts the connotation is less positive . <p> " Who said life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roses refer to easy living with everything being beautiful and positive . But as we know , every rose has a thorn . <p> " Its your baby ! " A baby symbolizes responsibility , and no wonder ! But it also symbolizes immaturity , helplessness or weakness . For example , " Do n't  be a baby ! " <p> " It was the dawn of a new era , " or " It suddenly dawned on me ! " Dawn or sunrise represent something new . <p> " In your twilight years , you want peace of mind . " Just as dawn symbolizes a fresh start , twilight symbolizes a period when things come to an end . <p> " Alcohol was his crutch . " A crutch helps us along , but it also symbolizes other ways to get by . <p> These forms of symbolism are so universal among English speakers that few people even think of the reasons for the symbolism behind them . <h> Are All Words Symbols ? <p> " Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute truth " ( Nietzsche ) <p> Its time to open your mind . Although we 've looked at words being used symbolically , Nietzsche contended that all words are symbols , and if you think about it , he was absolutely right ! A word is just a collection of syllables , but when we hear it , all sorts of ideas and associations come flooding into our minds . <p> These can be quite subjective . For instance , the word " lavender " could make you think of the countryside , or it could make you think of elderly people , your mothers garden , or perhaps a friend . It all depends on the personal associations or symbolism the word has to you . No wonder communication is such a minefield . <p> Have you ever found yourself arguing with someone who is basically agreeing with you in different words ? That 's because your frame of reference is different . The words you used do n't  have the same associations or symbolism for the other person as they do for you . <p> Words are symbols for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use them according to the thoughts you associate with those words . For example , if you had a happy childhood , the word " mother " brings along all kinds of positive associations , but for some- people , it just cant have the same effect , even when they understand the broader cultural context . <p> It would be impossible to show you an example of the way we use all words as symbols other than to say this entire article is a combination of symbols intended to convey a set of ideas . Because we have a shared context , the English language , most of the words mean similar things to all of us , but if your context differs from mine , you may have trouble understanding what I 'm trying to say . <h> Words Are Used Symbolically and All Words Are Symbols <p> So now you know . If you thought words were just words , think again . We may share a mutual understanding of words , or we may fail to understand one another because the symbols ( words ) mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame of reference . <p> Although there are many opinions on how many types of essays there are , everyone seems to agree on what you need to formulate a good paragraph . You 'll probably have read that a sentence expresses a single idea . A paragraph is a group of sentences dealing with a similar idea . As soon as you move on to a new set of ideas , you move on to a new paragraph . <p> When you create an essay outline , you will probably list ideas that need to be included in your essay . If you 're thinking clearly , each of these ideas would have a paragraph to itself . If some of the ideas you jotted down are closely related , theyd probably form part of the same paragraph . <h> Crafting a Paragraph <p> In a way , you could see each paragraph as a mini-essay . <p> You introduce the topic <p> You provide the contributing information <p> You draw a conclusion <p> But how do you know if you have crafted a good paragraph ? It will have four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You achieve these four characteristics through using the three parts of your paragraph wisely and with forethought . <h> First Sentence <p> The first sentence in a paragraph is important , and its called the " topic sentence . " It should represent the overall idea that governs the rest of the paragraphs content . Its the sames as your essay introduction leads into your essay . All the sentences that follow will contribute to this topic sentence . For example , in this paragraph , I began by telling you that the paragraph starts with a topic sentence . Now I am telling you what it is for , and how it relates to the other sentences in the paragraph . If you do this well , you 'll achieve the first of our characteristics : unity . <h> Contributing Sentences <p> Your contributing sentences must lead logically to the concluding one . This means you need to present it in some kind of order . Will you choose chronological order , order of importance , or relate each successive sentence to the other using logic ? That depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make your paragraph easy to follow from point A to point B to point C. Finally , you want to tie all your points together to underline the point you are trying to get across . Order helps to convey the sense of what you are saying . If you confuse your reader , you have not written a clever paragraph . <h> Order Should Bring Coherence <p> Have you ever listened to someone talking , and it sounds like they 're just babbling and not making any sense ? They are speaking incoherently . When a person speaks coherently , each thought follows neatly from the previous one , and it is easy to understand what they are saying . Although its not a must , using transition words helps to show how one thought relates to another . There are many such words and phrases which include : <p> Because <p> In addition <p> By contrast <p> Next <p> Afterward <p> Accordingly <p> No doubt <p> Of course <p> On the other hand <p> Naturally <p> Also <p> After <p> Before <p> Another important trick to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense . It just makes it so much easier for your reader to follow your thoughts . <h> Your Concluding Sentence <p> Do n't  leave your reader wondering " So what ? " at the end of your paragraph . Pull your threads together into a concluding sentence . It should support your introductory sentence while acknowledging what you have discussed in the supporting sentences . This helps your reader to see how the supporting information relates to the topic . You may think it is obvious , but your reader may not ! <h> Practice <p> Writing a really good paragraph is something of an art , but like any skill , you can learn it through practice . That 's why teachers will set paragraph writing tasks for their students . But if you love writing , or just want to improve your writing skills , there 's no reason why you should n't set yourself a few tasks . Choose from a list of paragraph writing prompts , or make up a list of your own . <p> Here are some ideas : <p> Why I enjoy my hobby so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Choose anything you like ) <p> Why I hope to become a <p> I think the most important thing about a person is <p> Why I admire my best friend <p> My favorite season is <p> My most embarrassing moment was when <p> The thing I 'm most scared of <p> What I dreamed last night <p> Remember , keep it to one paragraph ! After you 've written it , leave it for a while because its hard to evaluate your own work right away . Later , go and look at your exercise . Ask yourself : <p> What is my opening sentence ? <p> Do my other points support it ? <p> Did I reach a conclusion , and does it match the opening sentence and the supporting ones ? <p> Have I presented my information in a logical way ? Could I have done it better ? <p> Writing a paragraph is n't all that difficult , but you cant just run at it like a bull at a gate . If you think things through , you 'll find yourself naturally falling in with the rules we 've discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage your grey matter and get writing ! <p> To succeed at school , you need to be able to write different types of essays . Your teachers will seldom tell you exactly which type of essay you should be writing , so you need to be able to figure it out from the question you have been asked . Once you 've identified the right type of essay to answer the question , you 're not home free yet , but at least you 'll know how to structure it and what type of content to include . <p> There are various opinions on how to categorize essays and how many types of essay there are . The simplest interpretation says that there are only four types of essays : <p> I personally think this is a bit of an oversimplification . I also think there are overly complicated classifications of essays , so to keep things relatively simple , well stick to 10 types . Feel free to disagree with me if you like ! <h> Descriptive Essays <p> In this type of essay , you 're painting a word picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the experience , what it feels like , looks like , smells or sounds like . Your aim is to draw the reader in so he or she can experience what you are writing about in the same way you experienced it . <h> Definition Essays <p> A definition tells you what something is . Although a definition is short , a definition essay discusses a complex concept in much greater depth than you would get from a few lines . Theyre most often used to discuss philosophical or abstract topics . <h> Compare and Contrast Essays <p> Youll be given two similar-seeming yet different things to compare . To write this essay , I suggest that you prepare carefully . Which elements are the same ? Which ones are different ? Once you are sure you know what information you want to include , you 're ready to go . <h> Cause and Effect Essays <p> Although the name seems self-explanatory , we need to remember several causes can contribute to a single effect , and conversely , one cause could result in several effects . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War ( multiple causes , single effect ) . However , being in the war had several effects on the US ( single cause multiple effects ) . <h> Narrative Essays <p> If you like creative writing , these will be among your favorite essays . In a narrative essay , you tell a story . Remember , it has a beginning followed by a number of events that lead up to an ending . Plan carefully ! <h> Process Essays <p> This type of essay involves a step by step explanation of how something happens or is done . Getting your steps in the correct order is important if you do n't  want to turn your process into a muddle . Write your process essay in chronological order . <h> Argumentative Essays <p> Are you opinionated ? Good ! The argumentative essay explains your opinions and the reasons why you believe they 're right . You can even look at some possible counter-arguments and why you believe they 're wrong . Ultimately , you 're trying to get your reader to agree with you , so the more facts you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critical Essays <p> You do n't  have to criticize the thing you 're writing about unless you think there is reason for it , but you 'll be evaluating it critically . You 'll provide reasons why you think something was well done or badly done . If you think it was great , why did you think so ? Are there any faults that bothered you ? Why did they bother you ? What evidence can you present to support your opinion ? <h> Expository Essay <p> You could sum this type of essay up as follows , " Get all the facts , and then interpret them ! " You must reach a conclusion , and this has to be supported by your research or personal experience . In higher education , you have to show your ability to research your topic , and youll probably be citing experts along the way . In the end , you give your own opinion , but you 'll point out how several sources contribute to it . As long as there is logic in that , your answer ca n't be wrong . These essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may find yourself obtaining a new perspective or reaching a novel conclusion . <h> Persuasive Essays <p> In a way , these are similar to argumentative essays , but they 're not quite the same . An argumentative essay will hit people with the facts , while a persuasive essay has a softer touch and may appeal to moral values or emotions . See it as the difference between winning a debate and winning someone over to support a cause . There are differences , but also similarities . <h> What Type of Essay to Write ? <p> When looking at an instruction or exam question , study the VERBS your teacher has used . Circle them and think about what they imply . If you 've just been told to name or list things , give nothing but the facts . <p> Other words indicating that you should usually give nothing but the facts : <p> Analyze <p> Explain <p> Illustrate <p> Prove <p> Show <p> Compare <p> Contrast <p> Discuss <p> In addition , you want to look for words indicating that you should give your opinion : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you feel <p> If you have any doubt about the type of essay you should be writing , ask . While your teacher likely wont tell you when assigning , she will explain the correct type of essay to write for the particular situation and how you can figure that out . This should prove beneficial so you can deduct the correct type to write in future situations . <p> Are you writing a song ? Would you like it to be really catchy ? Why not go with what works for everyone , and use the most popular words found in hit songs ? If you 're wondering whether there actually are words that songwriters continually resort to , it wo n't take you long to hit on the word " love . " I have no idea how many songs contain that word , but I 'm ready to bet they number in the tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , or even millions ! <p> ALRIGHT ALREADY ! Ill stop ! Please do n't  hit me over the head again ! I thought it was an absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Wounded ! <h> In the Interests of Linguistics , Science and Music <p> Owing to the stiff critique my first ever song lyric faced , I decided to look for other words that are popular in songs . If I can find enough , I can make a song generator . You know : list of first lines , list of second lines , list of third lines join the dots between them and combine them anyhow you like , and voila ! One perfect song lyric . And in case you 're wondering , Ive seen it done , and it works ! <p> Before we can start generating phrases , we need the words . The first thing you 'll likely notice is popular words in songs tend to be short . You are n't  going to find a lot of Shakespeare in most popular song lyrics . You 'll also find words are rather genre specific . For instance , " dark , black , bloody , thunder , fire , ice , and angels " all sound like they fit into gothic or metal genres , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a great word ! You can write a whole song Noooo ! I promise I wont ! Just saying ! Put down that baseball bat ! ) <p> Feel ( Aw , cmon ! Are you saying I cant just use " Love , " " Yeah , " and " Feel " as the only words longer than three letters in my song ? No fair ! I thought I was getting real artistic depth there . So what if I added . ) <p> Girl ( There ! My song has a girl in it ! Better ? No ? Onward ! ) <p> Heart ( What , you want more ? Ok . What if I give you a whole bunch more words ? Will you let me write my song then ? Here goes at rapid fire . ) <h> Song Attempt Number Two <p> " Oh yeah ! Can you feel it girl ? Its a new life , a new dayNever say dieTake the night awayGive me time to dream " <p> Buzzers buzz . Got Talent judges give thumbs down . Objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has all the best words in it ! " <p> Gets booed off stage for being a spoilsport . Mutters , " I know what went wrong . It was all the times I used " the . " Next time , I 'll leave it out . " <p> Heads home and- sulks . Looks for more popular song words for music inspirations . Jackpot ! Now I have : <p> Baby <p> Good <p> Keep <p> Around <p> Again <p> Eye <p> Mind <p> Fall <p> World <p> Time <p> Hell <p> We <p> Like <p> Breathe <p> Ya <p> You <p> Thang <p> Get <p> Fire <p> Rock <p> Do n't  <p> Woman ( Oh ! My girls all grown up ! What a lot of letters she has now ! ) <p> Music <p> Dancing ( Another big word ! ) <p> Lonely <p> Like <p> Polka <p> Serenade <p> Boogie <p> Oops ! I slipped back to the 1940s with those last three . I thought they were rather strange . I mean , when last did you hear a song that goes : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night long ! " <p> I do n't  somehow think its going to hit the charts . <p> Favorite words in songs have changed through the decades as we saw with " Polka " once being a popular song staple . The reality is popular song words in the past ago are n't  the same as they are today . Let 's take a quick spin through the decades : <h> Since 2010 <p> We <p> Yeah <p> Hell <p> Die <p> What a cheerful bunch we are . I even had to censor one word out . Traveling back a decade <h> 2000s <p> U <p> Like <p> Breathe <p> It <p> Ya <p> Perhaps just a little more cheerful . And back again <h> 1990s <p> U <p> You <p> Up <p> Get <p> Thang <p> I never realized " thang " was retro . Rewind <h> 1980s <p> Love <p> Fire <p> Do n't  <p> Rock <p> On <p> Rock on that love and do n't  fire me ? <h> 1970s <p> Woman <p> Disco <p> Rock <p> Music <p> Dancin <p> Yay ! Let 's Disco , Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Little <p> Lonely <p> Cute ! Let 's twist , my lonely baby ! <h> 1950s <p> Christmas <p> Penny <p> Mambo <p> Three <p> I 'm not at all sure what to make of that ! <h> 1940s <p> Polka <p> Serenade <p> Boogie <p> Blue <p> Do n't  be Blue ! Let 's Boogie that Polka ! <h> 1930s <p> Moon <p> In <p> Swing <p> Sing <p> Let 's sing that swing in the moon Now what ? Woman ? Baby ? Girl ? Lady ? <h> 1920s <p> Blues <p> Pal <p> Sweetheart <p> Rose <p> Mammy <p> What a breadth of interests : family , horticulture , romance and friendship , and all tied together with a little melancholy ! <p> I think we 've taken the time machine far enough back to suit anyone , but for interests sake , the preceding two decades feature " Josh " as a top word . I am not sure who Josh is , but he was in a lot of songs . He may have been someones uncle , because " uncle " also hits top ratings . With my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . No ! Do n't  run away ! Really ! Some people . <p> When we try to decide which language is the hardest to learn , we have a problem . Everything , but everything , is subjective . There are a lot of factors that contribute to language learning difficulties . Broadly , we could sum these up as : <p> The language(s) you grew up speaking <p> Your attitude <p> Your personal context <p> If you grew up speaking English , learning to speak English is something you 've been doing since you were tiny , and English seems easy . Because its related to the Latin languages , Spanish , Italian and Portuguese should n't be all that difficult to also learn , and even French makes some kind of sense . However , in all these languages , you 'll have to get around some tenses and pronunciations that come naturally to native speakers , but which will seem awkward to you . <p> You 'll probably struggle with languages like Mandarin and Arabic because they are completely unrelated to any language you already know , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . <p> So , is English the hardest language to learn ? No . English can be difficult , but if you did n't  grow up speaking them , these languages are harder : <p> Mandarin : That tone system is difficult to master if your language does n't  have something similar . As for the alphabet , you 're going to take quite a lot of time just learning enough of it to get by . <p> Finnish : There are cases and cases within cases , it can be really tricky to navigate . <p> Arabic : There are four variations of each of the letters , and where you use them depends on where in the word they belong . <p> Japanese : Just try that alphabet there are 2,000 to 3,000 characters you must learn to have basic reading skills . <h> Why Is English Often Said to Be a Difficult Language ? <p> English is packed with linguistic quirks that might even make you think they were deliberately put there just to make the language difficult to learn . Do n't  take it personally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English so hard : <h> English Rules Are Hard with Multiple Exceptions <p> Just think of these inconsistencies : <p> The teacher taught . But the preacher never praught . <p> One goose , two geese . One moose , two mooses ( not meece ) <p> " Look " and " see " have similar meanings , but " overlook " and " oversee " mean completely different things . <p> One mouse , two mice . One house , two houses . <p> Vegetarians eat vegetables , but humanitarians do not live on a diet of people ! <p> I 'm sure you could come up with a few more of these if you thought about it . There are rules , there are exceptions to rules , and there are exceptions to the exceptions ! <h> The Correct Word Order Can Be Hard to Explain <p> Example : " Its a little fierce cat , " versus " Its a fierce little cat . " The second one just sounds right if you 're an English speaker , and if there 's a rule somewhere , I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fierce cat , " it would n't sound wrong at all . <p> I sometimes collaborate with a Dutch lady who is an excellent researcher , but I always have to change her wording . If I know why , I add a comment so that she can learn , but quite often , I cant explain why I made certain changes . <h> Weird spelling <p> English has its roots in many languages , and some spellings seem to have little to do with the way you pronounce a word . Just think of " yacht . " Its pronounced " yot , " but that 's not what the letters tell us ! Other weird ones include : <p> Through <p> Bough <p> Rough <p> All three end in " ough " but they are pronounced as " Thru , " " Bow , " and " Ruff " are we crazy ? <p> Then there are silent letters like the " h " in " Ghost " and the " b " in " Debt . " And as for the letter " c , " it cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or like a " k . " While were at it , by what logic did we decide some words end in " ck ? " <h> Inflection Changes Meaning at Least a Bit <p> Am I kidding ? No , I am not ! The words you place emphasis on can change the meaning of a sentence , even if its only slightly . Let 's look at an example <p> " I know I got that letter . " Place emphasis on the I , and suddenly you 're implying that someone else might not believe you or does n't  know what you know . <p> " I know I got that letter . " Now you 're wondering what happened to the letter , because despite the fact that you know you got it , you cant seem to find it . <p> " I know I got that letter . " Here you 're saying you received a letter , but another one did n't  turn up . <h> Regional Accents <p> I 'm sure this is true of other widely spoken languages too , but pity the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world might often sound like they 're speaking completely different languages ! We even have difficulty talking to each other sometimes . <p> When I was at school , we were very excited and interested when an Australian girl joined our class . There was just one problem : none of us could understand a word she said ! Closer to home , the US has many regional accents , and we can have difficulty communicating with our own countrymen and women . <h> English May Not Be the Hardest Language , but <p> If you 're an English speaker , do n't  mock others who struggle with your language . Who knows ? One day , you might find yourself in a position where you must learn theirs . Struggling with the complexities of English ( and there are plenty ) does n't  mean someone is stupid , and you should always encourage people to study new languages . <p> At the end of every year , we see a list of new words people started to use a lot and are being included in dictionaries as colloquialisms at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , but werent used much until some major event or trend triggered a revival . <p> To make this more fun , well also look into the crystal ball and make some predictions for the top words in 2017 . Feel free to contribute ! My crystal ball is a little cracked , so the picture is n't too clear . If you happen to have an HD crystal ball , I 'm sure you could contribute ! <h> 2016s top Word : and the winner is <p> Post-truth . If you do n't  know the meaning of this word , youd better learn it now . As you can tell , the prefix " post " means " after " and that 's followed by " truth " so this literally means " after the truth . " <p> However , as far as I can see , it has n't  got anything to do with what comes after the truth . Rather , it relates to something that happens completely outside of the truth , or at least is assumed based on flimsy evidence . It means thinking with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at facts . Apparently , its quite the trend these days , so switch off your smarts and go with your gut . Woohoo ! Suddenly , we all become geniuses ! <h> Other Brand-New Top 2016 Words <p> Brexit . No list of 2016s new words would be complete without Brexit . Initially coined to describe the UKs exit from the European Union , it has now come to mean anything that 's anti-globalization . Its also seen as implying passionate nationalism . I suspect that several other words will be coined to follow it , and well go into those a little later . <p> Trumpism . As you can tell , 2016 was a year for politics with the gloves off . Its been such a weird year that we 've had to create- new words to describe some of the new phenomena . Trump , love him or hate him , has certainly come up with a new post-truth style , and the utterances that arise from this have become known as " Trumpisms " this year . <p> Sharenting . Luckily , it has n't  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OMG ! Little Johnnys got his first tooth ! " moments . Go ahead , show your sharenting skills and post that pic . After all , I post pics of my kittens , and we can have some blissful relief from political discussion by entering an argument about which is cuter : your baby or my kittens ! <p> Uberization . Wow ! Guess what ? Spell check already recognizes this one . As you may have guessed , Uberization relates to the so-called " sharing economy " in which service providers offer services directly to prospective clients for less than theyd pay if they went through a company . <h> Existing ( and slightly altered ) Words Everyones Googling <p> Merriman-Webster lists these words as having been wildly popular in 2016 . <p> Surreal : " marked by the intense irrationality of a dream . " I kid you not , it has been a strange year , and the popularity of this word is a symptom of that . <p> Revenant : " one that returns after death or a long absence . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo DiCaprio to thank for getting it back onto everyones radar . <p> Icon : " a person who is very successful or admired . " Sigh . A lot of icons have died this year , and the headlines probably contained the word , leading folks to look it up for interests sake . <p> Bigly : Heres a fun one . Did you know that Trump never actually said " bigly ? " That 's what linguists are saying . Apparently , they have done voice analyses and report that Trump actually said " big league . " Who cares ? We heard " bigly ! " We like it ! <p> Irregardless : Merriam-Webster says that technically , " irregardless " is a word . However , it says that the word , which sparked a lexical storm after a commentator at the World Series final used it , is " non-standard . " Its nice that we can still get excited over trivia ! <h> What Will Be the Top Words for 2017 ? <p> I 'm going to TRY to stay clear of the political minefield in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are just not worth dying for , and feelings are running rather high at the moment . There 's just one political word prediction from me , and that 's " Nexit . " <p> What does Nexit mean ? Whoevers next to exit the EU , of course ! It could be a Frexit , or a Grexit , or a Dexit , or we could segue into a Swexit , but unless the UK ends up having a really , really hard time as a result of its decision , someones going to follow suit . Any bets ? <p> I can already see some words starting to trend , but I 'm afraid they 're political too . <p> Fascism and all its permutations seems incredibly popular at the moment . I do n't  think most people know what it really means , so I imagine there will be plenty of furtive googling so nobody has to actually ask . And no , this is not political commentary , merely an observation . <p> Apartheid is also doing the rounds once again . In case you did n't  know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . " It did n't  work for anyone , but once again , I see it gaining new popularity on social media right now . <p> Trump is going to gain a whole new meaning in 2017 . What will that be ? Time will tell . I suspect it wo n't have anything to do with a game of cards . <p> Then I suppose I should be a little creative too : <p> Phews is my own creation . It describes the phenomenon of fake news . Its a hybrid between " fake " and " news " with the " ph " to make it trendy . Its genius , really . Help me to make it go viral ! <p> Twentysixteen could catch on as a word to describe something that youd like to leave behind . Personally , I have no real problem with the year , but I think a slightly less exciting one would be nice for a change . <p> Post-politics will be way better than post-truth . I would suggest this word should mean getting on with ones life while ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only encourages them when they think were paying attention . The only problem with that is that one does have to watch them , if only out of the corner of your eye . <p> I 'll enjoy revisiting my list at the end of 2017 when were ready to enter into 2018 . To be honest , I look back fondly to the time when " selfie " was the number one word of the year . At the time , I thought it a warning symptom of a culture of narcissism , but compared to 2016s words , it was positively cheerful ! 
@@12747233 @1347233/ <h> Month : March 2016 <p> There are a number of words which can be confusing to those using English . Some examples include was vs were , who vs whom , and further vs farther . Another of those is onto and on to . They look so similar , and yet they are so different . When you 're talking , nobodys going to be looking for a space between on and to , but when you 're writing , that little space can make the difference between correct work and an embarrassing mistake . <p> There 's actually quite a big difference between on to and onto , but there 's also a really simple way to know which one of these options you should be using at any given time . Well first look at the reasons , and then well check out the cheat that will solve your dilemma without too much grammatical analysis . The big difference explained <h> When to use onto <p> Onto could , in many instances , be replaced with the less commonly used upon . It simply means that something landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . Although you might be pardoned for thinking it to be an adverb , its actually a preposition . For example : <p> The frog jumped onto the stone . <p> My cat crept onto my lap . <p> I do n't  know how the mayonnaise got onto my sweater . <p> In informal language , onto is also used to show that you 're on top of a situation , or well-informed : <p> I 'm onto your sneaky plan ! <p> Ill be onto the next task as soon as this one is done . <h> When to use on to <p> In this instance on is part of a phrase containing a verb and acts as an adverb , while to is a preposition linked to an object . For example : <p> She held on to the steering wheel . <p> I will log on to your website . <p> We had to move on to the next exhibit . <p> On is associated with the verbs held , log and move in these examples , while to links us to the object of the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> An easy cheat <p> To save yourself from the tricky business of sentence analysis every time you have to decide whether or not you 'll use on to or onto , try this cheat . In most cases , it will clarify which of the two you should use . <p> Try taking the word up and see how it fits into the sentence if you use it before on . If its a good fit , onto is likely to be the correct word choice . So , using the first of each of our sets of examples : <p> The frog jumped ( up ) onto the stone . <p> She held ( up ) on to the starring wheel . <p> As we can see , up fits well into the first example , but does n't  make any sense in the second . This cheat works nine times out of ten , but there may still be times when choosing between on and onto can be confusing . For instance : <p> We wandered on to the football field . <p> We wandered onto the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have slightly different meanings . In the first example , the speaker and his companions wandered from one place to another . They did n't  necessarily end up on the football field itself , but they chose to approach it . They moved on from one place to another . <p> In the second example , the group of people ended up on the football field itself . This could be compared with the frog jumping ( up ) onto a stone . So when all else fails , analysing the meaning you are trying to convey may help you with your dilemma . <h> In conclusion <p> As insignificant as the difference between onto and on to may seem , there are specific instances in which one or the other will be the correct choice . Working out which of the two is correct can be achieved by analysing the sentence , by checking on meaning , or by trying the word up before on as a cheat . If the sentence still makes sense with up inserted , then onto is correct . <p> Blogging , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it has one other thing in common with looking after your health it can be hard to get around to . You tell yourself that you 'll post three times a week , and before you know it , the week is over and you have n't written a single paragraph . If you find you do n't  post as often as you 'd like to on your blog , here are some fixes that you can try to write more each day . <h> Write your posts in the morning <p> Whether you think you are a morning person or not , research has shown that mornings are our strongest times for exercising willpower . All the choices we have to make throughout the day wear us out . By the time you get to relax in a quiet space in the evening , you 're more likely to flop down and watch TV than craft a great blog post . Get up earlier in the morning , and do some of the things you always mean to do but struggle to get round to . <h> Turn it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most days ) at a set time and you 'll build a habit . That means you do n't  even think about whether or not you will write . You just do it . It takes a bit longer than the 21 days that many people believe habit formation takes , but once you have established it , you 'll watch your blogging productivity soar . Even better , it does n't  have to be every single day you can take weekends off if you prefer . <h> Set daily word count goals <p> As part of building the habit of daily writing , its also good to set a daily word count goal . Its important to set a realistic goal that will make it likely that you 'll be able to achieve your daily goal so you continue it throughout the year . You might also want to write that book while you 're creating more blog content as well . <h> Take notes <p> Have you ever had a random flash of inspiration that you knew would make a wonderful blog post ? Then when you actually get around to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer remember what that great idea was ? This should never happen . Get into the habit of using your phone or a notebook to record sudden ideas , and expand on them a little so that you can re-discover your inspiration . That way , you wo n't find yourself thinking " What on earth did I mean by that ? " when you consult your little memo . <h> Write first , edit later <p> Do n't  interrupt the flow of your thoughts by pausing after every sentence or paragraph . Get your ideas fully roughed out and then go back to edit . That way , you wo n't lose your inspiration while you wrestle with typos , check your spelling and adjust your fonts . <h> Get some exercise before you begin <p> Exercise makes you alert and improves your concentration it also stimulates creative thinking . Does that sound crazy ? Researchers have found that people performed better in creative thinking tests after going for a run . Youll be in good company if you adopt this habit many famous artists and writers habitually took a brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A 30 second break can improve your mental clarity by up to 13% , and a two-minute break every half hour or so can work wonders for your productivity . Just looking up from your computer screen every now and then will reduce your fatigue . So if you want to be more productive take short , regular breaks . Stretch . Take a few deep breaths . Return to your writing feeling refreshed and alert . <h> Plan your distractions <p> While you 're researching your post , you may come across some interesting websites . Bookmark them for later rather than checking them out right there and then . Social media and email can also provide hours of distraction . And its not just a matter of sharing the occasional Facebook post or sending a Tweet . By the time you return to your writing , it will take a few minutes before you can get your thoughts back on track . Try the Pomodoro Technique where you focus for short bursts of 25 minutes . You can then schedule your planned distractions or use them as rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Draw a mind-map or rough out your subheadings before you begin writing . Not only will your work be more structured and have a good , logical flow , you 'll save yourself from losing the blog posts focus and having to delete chunks of irrelevant writing that does n't  have much to do with what you 're trying to get across . <h> Research before you write <p> Instead of researching while you 're actually writing , try to do all your online research before you even begin . You can copy-paste relevant paragraphs under your sub-headings so that you do n't  have to look through umpteen open tabs to find the nugget of information you wanted to include in part of your article . This should make the blog writing smoother and help you get the post done in less time . <h> Choose a quiet uncluttered environment <p> Have you ever noticed how easy it is to get a lot of work done in the library ? The quiet atmosphere and the lack of distractions will work wonders . Keep this in mind when choosing your workspace for blogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kids demanding attention and chores staring you in the face whenever you look up from your work . Some people are better able to tune out noise and distractions than others , but you still wont be at your most productive . Find a distraction-free place to write and make that your writing area each morning . <p> English can be difficult , especially when it comes to words that can be easily confused . A couple of examples would be who vs whom and further vs farther . Another combo that can get confusing is was vs were . <p> There are several reasons why you might be struggling to decide whether you should be using " was " or " were " in a sentence . The simplest of these is the conjugation of the singular and plural forms of the past tense of " to be . " While this can cause minor problems to those learning English as a second language as they study , first language English speakers usually have few problems with this . The most common cause of debate and confusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the subjunctive mood ( Well explain that below if you are n't  sure what subjunctive mood is . ) . Well cover both past and subjunctive mood topics in this article , and you 'll soon see just how simple it all is . <h> Singular and Plural <p> As we 've observed , this is the easiest of the choices you need to make , but it also gives rise to the problems that so many people have when they begin to use the subjunctive mood . <p> Singular : I was , he was , she was , it was BUT you were . ( Just to make things more fun ! ) <p> Plural : Its always were , regardless of whether were talking about " they , " " we " or " you . " So far , so easy ! But now well examine how this relates to one of the most common errors in spoken or written English : the choice of " was " instead of " were " in the subjunctive mood . <h> If I were / was a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to describe or speculate on a hypothetical situation , and you 'll hear people using both " was " and " were " in this context . But only one of these is correct . Whenever were talking about something that is n't a reality at the moment , we discard " was " and choose " were " instead . It does n't  matter whether we are referring to a single person or a group of people . As soon as we cross the border between reality and speculation , " were " is the only word to choose . For example <p> I was rich and I owned a house at the seaside . <p> If I were rich , I would have owned a house at the seaside . <p> He was the captain of the team and he chose a different strategy . <p> If he were captain of the team , he would have chosen a different strategy . <p> In each of the pairs of sentences above , the first one refers to something that actually happened in the past , and the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wish or a speculation it refers to an event that did not actually happen , and " were " is the correct choice . <p> They were the winning team , so they celebrated their victory . <p> If they were the winning team , they would celebrate their victory . <p> As we can see , the subjunctive mood does n't  result in any change in word choice in this example . No matter how many people you are referring to , the subjunctive mood calls for the word " were . " If you 've been prone to saying the incorrect " I wish I was , " " If he was " or " I wish she was " instead of the correct I wish I were , " " If he were " or " I wish she were , " it will be easy to make the necessary adaptation and correct your grammar . <p> Look out for the subjunctive mood . As soon as something is a wish or a hypothetical ( if ) situation , you will always choose " were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . In spoken as well as written English , you 'll find that just about everyone from plumbers to presidents is guilty of this mistake . Of course , when presidents make this error , those who know better will laugh at them , so if you 're hoping that what you say will be taken seriously , its worth learning when to use " were " instead of " was . " After all , once you understand the basic rules , its quite easy . <p> If you have decided this is the year you 're going to write that novel you 've always told yourself you want to write , one aspect you need to consider when putting it together is how long it should be ( if you want the best chance to get the novel published ) . There are no hard and fast rules on how long a novel should be if you 're writing for your own pleasure . But if you 're hoping to get it into print , publishers have certain expectations . Knowing what these are will give you a goal to shoot for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get an unusually short book or an exceptionally long one published is something you should leave until you 've made a name for yourself . <p> When considering novels , its important to note there are a large variety of genres . As a general guideline , well include romances , thrillers , detective stories and attempts to make a mark in the world of serious literature as the core adult novels . While there are certainly other types of novels ( see science fiction and fantasy below ) , this should cover most of these . So , how many words should there be in a novel you want to get published ? Novels should be between 80,000 to 90,000 words . <p> Publishers like to see 80,000 to just under 90,000 words for the average adult novel . 70,000 to just under 80,000 could be accepted , but might be seen as being a trifle too short . Anything less than 70,000 words is definitely too short . Novels over 100,000 words are getting to be on the long side . Anything over 110,000 words will almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reason for the upper limit is that printing costs increase once you exceed that word count . That 's not to say that books as long or longer havent been successfully printed , but agents would regard something that ambitious as an epic or a saga , and unless you 're already well known , an overly lengthy book could hurt your chances of finding an agent and getting published . <p> The lower word count limit is based on reader preferences . Are you giving your reader enough meat so they find the book satisfying ? Unless you 're producing a very light read , probably not . Once again , trying to push the lower limits for a novel is best attempted once you already have a following and are making your publisher a lot of money . <p> Science Fiction and Fantasy novels break the above word count rules and can be longer How many words are there in a Sci-Fi or Fantasy novel ? Science Fiction and Fantasy books should be 90,000 to 125,000 words . <p> The acceptance of a more ambitious word count in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( presumably ) original concepts . The issue to remember is the caveat about printing costs . When you 're going into print for the first time , you 're generally considered a bad risk , so going over 110,000 words might cause your publisher to have second thoughts . For your first Sci-Fi or Fantasy novel , you would do yourself a favor to try and come in on the lower end of 90,000 to 100,000 words to have the best shot at finding an agent or publisher . <p> Successful business proposals require a huge amount of effort . They may involve the collaboration of several different parties . Business proposals require facts and figures which are backed by solid research . Their tone is formal and content needs to promote the objectives contained therein . A business proposal must look and feel attractive . The golden rule to remember is " first impressions count . " <p> Its a great pity that many otherwise fantastic business proposals fall flat . A common theme apparent in the vast majority of rejections is based on the golden rule . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , at least not in their favor . And one of the questions that probably was never asked that may have helped was , " What is the best font for a business proposal ? " <p> While the choice of font may seem inconsequential , it does in fact play a very important role . On a sub-conscious level , font tells the reader more about what they are reading . Fonts help set the tone . Consider typical outdoor signage used by a nursery school . The letters are large , simple , bold and contain an assortment of bright colors . Tots and toddlers play school . They give the impression of fun . <p> Signage outside a lawyers office would be noticeably different . The choice of color would be uniform throughout , while the font itself would be smaller . It would imply that this is a business environment . Do not expect to find unicorns dancing on any rainbows here . J S Shark and associates . Attorneys at law . <p> It should be evident that the font used in a proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signage . The subliminal message should be clear ; this proposal is serious . It means a lot , has been well-researched and contains information of value . It was not banged together using a sloppy approach . It should speak for itself . It needs to say , " I am important . Read me in my entirety . Pay attention to my content . It may lead to a very rewarding experience , benefiting both your business and its clientele . " So what is the best font for a business proposal ? <p> Before answering that question , it is important to distinguish between the different types of fonts . There are literally thousands of fonts available . Some are free , others not . Some fonts are exclusive . They are used to establish or entrench a corporate identity . An example here is the Coca Cola font with its famous curling ribbon . <p> Fonts such as these may have patents or legal clauses ( similar to logos ) which prevent their commercial use by unauthorized 3rd parties . Some fonts are all in upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these can be classed into two separate categories . Serif and sans-serif . <p> Serif fonts , such as Times New Roman , have small " feet " at the bottom of certain letters . A further characteristic particular to a serif font is the " curly bits " found at the top and bottom of certain letters . These " frills " cause the eye to travel in a straight line . This means that serif fonts are easier to read when they are printed into document format . <p> If the proposal is going to be submitted as an actual document i.e. , printed and not as an electronic submission , then the body of the proposal should comprise of a single serif font used throughout . I tend to stick with what works well . For me , that is Times New Roman . For headings I generally go with a sans-serif font like Verdana or Helvetica . On the rare occasion when I require a large heading which will stand out above the others , then Arial Black is the way to go . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits . " They include examples such as Arial Black and Verdana , neither of which has letters with feet or curly bits . These fonts were mostly used to distinguish paragraph headings from the main body of text . With the arrival of electronic communication , it was noted that sans-serif fonts are easier to read on computer screens than the serif versions . With some screens set to a low resolution , the " frilly bits " associated with serif fonts tend to make the font look blurry or out of focus . This would reflect poorly on your proposal . <p> If your proposal is going to be submitted electronically , then the body of the proposal should comprise of a single sans-serif font , to be used throughout . Verdana or Helvetica are excellent choices for the digital layout and are making their socially acceptable appearance in some printed formats too . <p> Headings or the introduction of new ideas should differ from the main body of text . Most people agree that a simple Arial Black or Verdana as a font for headings will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud " fonts such as Goudy Stout . Also avoid " hand-written " fonts or fonts that are childish or too " busy . " By busy , I mean overly elaborate fonts which contain elements of advanced calligraphy and stick to it throughout . Having different headings in different fonts , using various sizes and colors , while alternating between bold and italics does not work . Do n't  do it ; just do n't  ! Your proposal will end up looking like a ransom note from a cheesy B grade movie , rather than the slick and professional business proposal you need to deliver . <p> There were a number of articles that made the claim that Donald Trump spoke at a fourth grade level . They made this determination by running the different candidates presidential announcement speeches through the Flesch " Kincaid readability test . The problem with using a prepared speech is that there 's a good chance that a speech is n't how the candidates actually talk . There 's even a good chance the speech was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better way to determine the speaking level of the candidates would be to analyze them talking in a non-speech setting . <p> It should be noted there are some limitations to the speaking level designations found below . The Dale " Chall readability formula gives a general approximation to the candidates speaking level , but it is n't conclusive . The candidates likely move among levels depending on where and when they are speaking . This was also a single debate where many of the topics use words outside the 3,000 core words that are the foundation of the formula . If the candidates were speaking about everyday events , their speaking level could be much lower than was found in this debate . <p> These were the results : <h> Donald Trump Speaking Level <p> Donald trump ended up with a 7th to 8th grade speaking level which is better than a 4th grade level , but it was still the lowest of the four candidates . He also spoke the most words during the debate ( 5,520 ) , but used the fewest number of unique words ( 933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3,831 ) , but had 70 more ( 1,003 ) unique words than Trump . John Kasich had almost the same number of unique words ( 940 ) as Trump , but spoke over 1,500 fewer words than Trump did during the debate . <h> Ted Cruz Speaking Level <p> Ted Cruz spoke the fewest number of words during the debate ( 3,831 ) , but had the highest speaking level ( 11th to 12th grade ) of the four candidates . The length of his sentences were also the longest at 16 words ( tied with Kasich ) . <h> John Kasich Speaking Level <p> John Kasich just barely spoke more words than Cruz during the debate . He had 3,852 words compared to 3,831 for Cruz . These were both over 1,600 words fewer than Trump . Kasichs speaking level came in between Trump on the low end and Cruz at the high end with a 9th to 10th grade level . <h> Marco Rubio Speaking Level <p> Marco Rubio ended up speaking the second highest number of words during the debate . He clocked in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Kasich , ended up with a mid speaking level at 9th to 10th grade . <p> Even though these stats show Trump uses higher than a 4th grade speaking level when his speeches are n't  prepared , he does speak like a junior high school student while all the other candidates he s running against speak at a high school level . <p> One of the popular features on WordCounter is the goal setter ( button right above the text input area ) . This allows users to set a word count goal which allows them to see their progress toward that goal as they type into the text area . What a lot of people do n't  notice is that there is actually a way to embed this counter into a website or blog allowing others to also see how you 're progressing on your word count goals . <p> To embed the free word count tracker , all you need to do is click on the earth icon to the right of the tracker once you have set a goal . Hovering over this icon , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click on it , you 'll be given a couple of choices on the appearance of your word count tracker . You can choose the size ( small , medium or large ) and the color ( blue , red , green , yellow , pink , cyan , brown , purple or orange ) . Once you 've made these two choices , you simply click on the " save and get code " button . This will give you code that you can then place on your blog or website . <p> One of the advantages of this word count tracker is you never have to manually input the number of words you have written to update the counter . As you add words to your writing in the text area on WordCounter , the tracker will automatically update . This allows others to know how you 're doing in real time toward your writing goals . <p> There are a couple of ways you might want to use this . For example , if you write blog articles and you have a daily goal of writing 1000 words a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see where you 're at during the course of the day ( and whether you meet your goal ) . Then you can begin from zero the next morning and continue to repeat day after day . <p> If you have a longer piece of writing , you can set the goal as much larger . For example , maybe your goal is to write 50,000 words for a single project . You can set up the tracker for this amount and everyone will be able to see how your are progressing toward the longer-term goal . <p> No matter how you choose to use the word count tracker , its a great way to keep you accountable to the writing goals you set for yourself . Stating your writing goals and placing them out there so all can see is a great way to keep yourself honest , and it can be a great motivator to write on a daily basis . If you truly want to get a good amount of writing done daily ( or over a longer period of time ) using one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I usually have a minimum writing goal of 500 words a day , although I sometimes increase it for certain periods when I need to be extra productive . You can see the tracker I use below . <p> If you listen to a National Basketball Association ( NBA ) game on television or the radio , there 's a good chance that at some point during the telecast , you 'll hear the announcers say that a player is " dropping a dime " or some similar variation of that sentence . You can sometimes see the reference in commercials with basketball players as well . For those who are n't  familiar with its meaning , it sounds strange and out of place and the chances are you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about . <h> What is a " dime " referring to in basketball ? <p> A " dime " in basketball is the same thing as an assist . For those unfamiliar , a basketball assist occurs when one player makes a pass to a teammate which leads that teammate to score a basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player has " assisted " in the making of the basket . <p> Usually , an assist is recorded when a pass is made to the teammate and the teammate then shoots and makes a basket without dribbling the ball , but this is n't a hard-set rule . While this is the case most of the time , there is some judgement involved when considering whether an assist has been made or not . For example , a player who passes to a teammate who is breaking toward the basket and that teammate dribbles once while continuing the cut toward the basket would be given an assist even though the player dribbled . <p> Assists are an important statistic kept for basketball players during each game . Assists are one of the big four statistics ( assists , points scored , steals and blocks ) tallied each game . They 're also recorded on a career level as well as career assists . The statistic is important and valued in basketball because setting up teammates with good passes can lead to easier baskets than for the player to try to score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a dime ? <p> The origin of a basketball assist being called a dime is n't readily known . There are a variety of theories , but the most common assumption is that it came from earlier times when pay phones were available across the US . When payphones were most popular ( long before cell phones were the norm ) it cost a dime to make a phone call . If one needed to make a phone call , it was common for that person to ask , " does anyone have a dime ? " In this sense , " dropping a dime " or giving someone a dime was assisting someone to make a phone call . Most people believe this phrase ended up transferring over to the NBA as helping a teammate make a basket . <p> Although " dropping a dime " is considered a positive move for basketball , it does n't  always have positive connotations when used in other circumstances . For example , " dropping a dime " is a way to label a person a snitch or someone who tells on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone call is used as when someone tells ( calls ) authorities to inform someone has broken the law , thus snitching on them . <p> Another popular theory is that it comes from the phrases " dropping it on a dime , " " turning on a dime , " " at a drop of a dime , " and " stopping on a dime . " These phrases all refer to precision , doing it quickly and without hesitation all characteristics of most assists in basketball . A quick pass right on the mark to a teammate will assist that teammate in scoring . 
@@12747234 @1347234/ <h> Become a Better Writer : Preserve and Improve Your Reading Skills <p> Its no secret that reading and writing go hand in hand . Most successful writers are avid readers . We learn our craft by reading and dissecting the works of others . We take inspiration from them and we learn from their failures . But our reading skills may not be what they once were . New research shows that the Internet , with all of its links , short paragraphs , and volumes of information may be changing the way we read and the way our brains process information . And not for the better . <p> Many people now report problems reading more challenging works , or concentrating on a book for a sustained period of time . Even easier works are getting skimmed and major plot points and facts are being missed . Were becoming so used to skimming for key words and hopping from a link to a video to an image that were losing our ability to process information in a deep and meaningful way . <p> This presents a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely tied to our reading skills , deteriorating reading skills equal deteriorating writing skills . Think about it : If you cant read a challenging work , or concentrate long enough to read anything longer than a grocery list , what makes you think you can write anything that 's lengthy or challenging ? What makes you think you can edit your book if you cant concentrate or stop skimming long enough to make sense of what you 've written and detect the flaws in it ? <p> Deteriorating reading skills might not be a problem if you 're writing for the web and you can get away with always writing small bits of information and editing tiny chunks , but its a problem if you 're writing novels , non-fiction books or long manuals . To write well , we writers need to actively preserve and improve our reading skills . If you find yourself struggling , here are some ideas to sharpen and protect your ability to read deeply . <h> Read without distractions <p> Do n't  read with the TV on or your cell phone beeping next to you . Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down at the TV every five minutes or checking your messages , you 're simply further fragmenting your attention span . Find a quiet place , turn off the distractions and just read . <h> Read more challenging works <p> Its easy to get complacent about your reading skills . If you 're only reading easy , fluffy works , its easy to think that everything is fine . And then you pull out that scientific book or literary novel . Then you see that your reading is n't what it once was . Take the time to read something more challenging for you . It may be something outside of your field , or something that 's above the level at which you usually read . These books will force you to bring your best reading skills and practice those that are weakening . <h> Take it offline once in a while <p> The Internet makes it easy to research a topic very quickly . But to preserve your ability to make sense of information you need to take it offline once in a while . Check out some actual books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be improving your reading skills , you might find that you end up with higher quality research and a better understanding of the topic when you engage deeply with the material instead of just hitting the high points . This understanding will translate on the page in the form of higher quality work . <h> Observe yourself <p> If you find yourself skimming a work , stop , go back to where your concentration faltered , and begin again . Become aware of when your reading turns to skimming , or when you find yourself thinking about what to make for dinner while you 're simply scanning a work . Turn your full attention back to the work . <h> Take breaks <p> Reading deeply is like exercise . Its easy once you 've gotten in shape but its hard and sometimes painful if that muscle is n't up to it yet . Pace yourself and take breaks if you need to . Fifteen minutes of total concentration is better than an hour of frustration , frequent skimming , and telling yourself that its almost over . If you need a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer periods after you practice for a while . <h> Reread <p> After you 've read something , particularly something that really challenges you , go back and read it again . You 'll probably be surprised to find that there are still areas that you skimmed , or pieces that you missed entirely . The more you read , the less often this will happen and the less rereading you 'll have to do , but in the beginning of training or retraining your brain , rereading can be a valuable way to improve comprehension . <h> Take your time <p> Were so busy today that its hard to simply sit down and read but that 's exactly what you 'll have to do . Reading fast is not the way you improve your understanding and concentration . You have to slow down . <h> Take notes <p> You probably havent done this since college , unless you were researching an in-depth project . Note-taking can increase your comprehension by forcing you to slow down and identify key pieces of information . <h> Go deep <p> Read several books about the same topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read on one subject or study one author , the better you become at seeing connections amongst the concepts , or noticing what makes this novelist successful ( or not ) . Flitting from author to author or subject to subject can be fun , but it can also contribute to some of the same problems that the Internet presents . <h> Regurgitate <p> When you finish reading a work , take the time to write out a summary or a review of the work . Again , this is probably something you have n't done since your school days , but writing out what you remember from the work shows you how well you 're comprehending it . If all you can say about " Watership Down " is , " It was good . There were bunnies , " clearly you 've got a problem . If you can describe the characters and the themes of the book and summarize the whole plot , you 're on your way . <p> More than ever our reading skills are not something we can take for granted . It used to be that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful reading life . You did n't  have to do much to keep your skills sharp . Simply reading for pleasure and reading the newspaper was often enough Now , though , deep reading skills are harder to maintain . The Internet is a great thing but if were not careful , it can actually rewire our brains in ways that are not favorable to writers who depend on reading comprehension and concentration to work . Practice your reading the same way you practice your writing . Its the only way to ensure that your reading activities can help , not hinder , your writing efforts . <p> I think reading is an underappreciated aspect of good writing . The more you read , the more you understand the difference between good and poor writing . There is something you can take away from every book whether that be something that you want to use or something that you do n't  ever want to do to make your writing so much better . If you want to write , learn to love to read ! <p> I cant agree more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age when kids have books read to them . Read to them more than you think you should and as often as you can . They will thank you for it when they get older . <p> I 'm up for a voracious reader and even though I do n't  do a lot of writing , my writing tends to be better than average because of all the reading I do . Even though the two do n't  seem to have anything to do with one another , they really do . 
@@12747235 @1347235/ <h> Tag : sentences <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences in a paragraph , there 's no single answer to this question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general , you 'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea , and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you 'd expect . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your readers attention and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> " White Space " is a great way to make your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the answer is " It depends " Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a blog post , and I want to keep the reader engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses 37 words . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers , for example : <p> " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " Cool ! " <p> As you can see , I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves . Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long . <h> Academic Writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips , 2014 ) with references . Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon see why this should be the case ( Me , 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many words per paragraph ? Its really up to you ! <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . <p> Making them too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader . A lot of text without " white space " is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to digest . So , whatever you do , do n't  forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to baffle the reader . <p> By the way , the above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't always better ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of confusion , but if you 're looking for a general answer to the question , " How many sentences in a paragraph ? " the answer is there are 3 to 8 sentences in a paragraph . The important key to take away from this answer is that its a rule-of-thumb . If you 're looking for a hard and fast rule , you 're out of luck . A paragraph can consist of a single sentence , and since a single word can be a sentence , you can literally have a paragraph that consists of a single word . Of course , if someone asks you to write a paragraph , they wont be altogether happy with that , so how much should you write ? <h> What do teachers want to see in a paragraph ? <p> If you 're a student , your teacher or tutor may ask you to write a paragraph without telling you just how long he or she expects it to be . In general , educators like to see a paragraph consisting of at least 5 sentences . Start with a sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for providing information that supports that idea , and use the final sentence to draw a conclusion . <p> Why do teachers expect longer paragraphs ? Obviously , they want to see that you have acquired knowledge and can think critically . That 's quite difficult- to demonstrate with a single sentence ! Teachers will sometimes set a rule that all paragraphs should be a certain length , but its important to remember that specific paragraph lengths are n't  a prerequisite for acceptable writing . <h> When do you use shorter paragraphs ? <p> Open just about any book , and you 'll find plenty of short paragraphs . If direct speech is used , therell be a new paragraph every time a new speaker starts to talk . News writers also like using short paragraphs . They have to present information in a succinct way and hold the readers attention . <p> Commercial writers know that most people do n't  want to read 1,000 words of closely-spaced text in order to see what they are writing about , so they also like to keep sentences and paragraphs short . Theyll even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph is about before you read it . <h> How do I know when to start a new paragraph ? <p> Every time you begin- to discuss a new thought that contributes to the overarching theme of your work , you can start- a new paragraph . A paragraph will usually consist of a collection of sentences that , when considered as a group , have something in common . As soon as you move on to the next idea , you can begin a new paragraph . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to agonise about it too much , because as I 've pointed out , there are no specific rules . <h> Tips for writing strong paragraphs <p> Its best to begin a paragraph with a sentence that defines the topic that will be discussed . Try to keep it fairly simple . If you include too many ideas in your opening sentence , you run the risk of getting tangled in an overly complex and incoherent paragraph . Every sentence in a paragraph should support the first , " topic sentence . " When you begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph . <p> The University of North Carolina helps students with paragraph construction by providing them with a 5-step process : <p> Express the idea that the paragraph will cover in a topic sentence . <p> Explain the idea . <p> Use an example . <p> Explain why the example relates to the idea . <p> Draw a conclusion . <p> Obviously , the recipe has been designed for those who want to write an informative and convincing work . And because these rules are n't  really cast in stone , you 'll find that different institutions give different recommendations . <h> The debate continues <p> If we look around , well find that the idea of paragraphs with a minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common . But there are some who say that two to three paragraphs per page are best and others who say that 5 to 7 lines will do the job . Meanwhile , journalism students are taught to keep sentences as short as possible , and one sentence paragraphs are considered perfectly acceptable . <p> There are those who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly alright , and since there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs , I cant really contradict them . I even found one recommendation that suggested a minimum of 7-10 sentences per paragraph and a maximum of a full page ! <h> How long should your paragraphs be ? <p> Unless you 're busy with academic writing , the length of your paragraphs is up to you . I like shorter paragraphs for informal writing such as this blog post . I like the idea of sticking to one idea per paragraph , and I think that paragraphs make reading and understanding a text a whole lot simpler . Single-sentence paragraphs are great for emphasis . <p> If you are writing to pass a school , college or university course , I recommend you ask your teacher or professor what 's expected of you . Its always better to ask in these situations than to try to guess . This is by far the best way to make sure you tailor your writing to what your teacher expects rather than by going by a general rule . 
@@12747236 @1347236/ <h> Month : August 2016 <p> Is it simple , or is it easy ? Let 's put it this way , there are a lot of things that are simple , but are n't  in the least bit easy , and there are other differences too . Let 's start with that first one . You want to write a book . Its simple , is n't it ? All you need to do is sit down in front of the computer and type . But is that easy ? <p> The day you decide to begin writing , your kids decide to invite all their friends over resulting in a houseful of chaos . The six hours of quiet time you planned for writing never materializes . On the second day , you set aside the time but also come down with a case of writers block . The knowledge of what you need to do is simple to understand , but actually doing it is n't as easy as you imagined . <p> You decide you 'd like to become a rock star . Its simple . All you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good song , and capture the attention of a powerful person in the music business . Is it easy ? Probably not . Learning to play the guitar will take years of practice , you 've got a tin ear , and as for the song and the high-powered producer , even once you learn to play , neither of those goals is easy . <p> You want to live forever . Its simple ! All you have to do is avoid dying . Oh dear ! That 's impossible ! Douglas Adams said that flying is as simple as falling and not hitting the ground . How I wish it was easy to do that ! Despite numerous attempts , I still have n't gotten it right . <p> Yes , there are a lot of things that are simple but are n't  easy . There are even simple things that are absolutely impossible . <h> Living the Simple Life vs Living an Easy Life <p> Easy living and simple living are two different things . Living a simple life means having few material things , doing things the natural way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , is usually associated with having all the luxuries that money can buy ! What 's more , the simple life is hard work , but the easy life means avoiding hard work at all costs . <h> Being Simple and Being Easy <p> Saying that someone is a bit simple means that they 're actually a little stupid . As for saying someone is easy , there are various interpretations , one of them being that they 're laid-back and relaxed , while the other is far less complimentary , but as you can see , being easy is definitely not the same thing as being simple . <h> Sometimes Simple Things Really Are Easy <p> Let 's get serious now . I went and hunted through online dictionaries to get all the possible meanings of these two words . I must say , a lot of the dictionary entries were disappointing because they did n't  have all the possible definitions . I soon found that simply getting a complete dictionary entry , while it should be simple , is n't easy . Then I had an " Aha " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy solution and it was simple too ! <h> Definitions of " Simple " <p> " Simple " can indeed mean that something is easy . " 1 + 1 = 2 is a very simple bit of math . " <p> Something that is basic or fundamental is also simple . " Its a simple truth : falling and missing the ground is impossible . " <p> " Simple " can also be used to show that something is n't complicated or fancy . " She wore a simple black dress . " <p> In scholarly language , it could mean that a thing is n't in a compound form . That applies to math , botany , and English grammar . <p> As we 've seen , it could mean that someone is a bit dumb . <p> And historically , a simple was a medicinal herb . <h> Definitions of " Easy " <p> An easy thing is one that is not difficult to do . " It was easy to walk up the hill . " <p> An easy life is laid back and free of worry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars . " <p> It could mean that someone is free of awkwardness : " He won them over with his easy charm , " or " Her easy manner made her popular . " <p> Unfortunately , it can also mean that someone or something is vulnerable . " Women who walk alone at night are easy targets for criminals . " <p> It can even be an insult . " She has a reputation for being easy . " <p> Lastly , you can use " easy " as an exclamation : " Easy , Butch ! Do n't  bark so excitedly ! " <h> Similar , but Not Quite the Same <p> There are times when " easy " and " simple " are interchangeable , but there are times when they are n't  . It all depends on context . By now , you 're an expert on the differences and similarities between " simple " and " easy . " Wasnt that simple ? It was easy too ! <p> Who does n't  want to be considered at least somewhat artistic ? Its not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hit the big time , but having an artistic hobby is said to be good for oneself , and we all tend to think creative people are somewhat special . Drawing , painting , sculpting , and music are generally considered to rank highly among the arts , but what about writing ? Is writing an art , too ? <h> The Making of an Art <p> When we think of most types of writing , art is n't something that immediately comes to mind . An exception may be poetry , which is generally considered quite artistic . But can other forms of writing be an art ? <p> According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary , art is the use of creativity , skill , and imagination to create something that 's beautiful or emotionally expressive . I contend that this definition needs to be expanded . If you dig a little deeper , you 'll see that the same dictionary says that any skill can be termed an art . Thus you have the art of salesmanship , the art of diplomacy , and even the art of making friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly if you exercise a little imagination and creativity in the process . <h> How to Be an Artistic Writer <p> Although its true that being a writer of legal documents is an art because you have to do some pretty deep thinking and produce watertight work , I doubt whether anyone would consider a lawyer to be an artist in the truest sense of the word . There are also those who practice the art of brevity in their writing , giving you only the bare facts . Although I appreciate this when I want to quickly get to the heart of the matter , it is n't always appropriate , and it can be a bit boring to read . <p> " It was a nice day . We went to the restaurant and had a meal . Then we went home . " Its all rather ho-hum and boring , is n't it ? <p> " It was a wonderful day with only a few fluffy clouds scudding across a sky so blue it defied description . We chose a charming restaurant with a courtyard shaded by trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gurgling fountain . After lunch , we took the scenic route home along the lakeshore , rattling and bumping along on the untarred surface . " <p> It probably is n't worthy of a William Wordsworth , who would no doubt have waxed considerably more poetically , I would bet that most people would find the second piece is more creative and descriptive . You should be able to form mental pictures from the words used : the lovely weather , the pleasant restaurant , and the bumpy ride home are all more clearly drawn in this word-picture . <h> Try These Tips <p> Create atmosphere with sensory language . What sights , smells , sensations and sounds would you like your reader to imagine ? <p> Introduce an element of the unexpected . Choose words carefully , and create new words and idioms if inspiration strikes . Find new ways to say ordinary things . <p> Be yourself . Trying to emulate a writing style will produce a poor copy of someone elses work . The more original you are , the better . <p> Avoid lengthy descriptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of a list of tips to improve your writing , is you should break any and all rules when appropriate . <p> Any kind of writing can be an art , but creative thinking is the key . Whether you plan to immerse yourself in writing poetry , believe there 's a novel in you trying to get out , or are simply tackling an essay or a blog post , your creative thinking and skill can combine to turn it into a work of art . <p> Although creative fiction or poetry writing is generally considered artier than factual writing , I have read wonderfully entertaining and interesting non-fiction articles and books . What made them different ? There was definitely an element of creativity in the way the information was presented . They made you want to read on and find out more . Any kind of writing can be considered an art , but real creativity is what turns writing into something special . Its not what you have that matters , but what you do with it . <p> There are a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the wrong word to use in the context of havoc , but I 'm here to tell you it is n't . Read on and be liberated ! Together well wreak havoc on the Grammar Nazis ! To understand why I 'm going against the mainstream opinion , you need to know only one thing : I have a darned good source to back me up . <p> To begin with , let 's look at some word meanings : <p> Wreaked : Caused <p> Wrought : Worked <p> Now let 's look at some sentences for the sake of context : <p> " The hurricane has caused havoc in the town " <p> " The hurricane has wreaked havoc in the town . " <p> " The hurricane has worked havoc in the town . " <p> " The hurricane has wrought havoc in the town . " <p> Guess what ? They 're all correct . Of course , if you were using " wrought " under the impression that it was the past tense of " wreak , " you 'd be wrong , but intention does n't  show or matter in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a trifle odd , but it has also been suggested by many as a rather more modern word that could be used to replace " wreaking " which we seldom do these days . <p> However , there is one thing that a hurricane never , ever does : <p> " The hurricane wrecked havoc . " <p> This would imply that a remarkably tidy hurricane arrived in a crazy town that was in a state of utter chaos , and tidied everything away neatly , thereby depriving the citizens of the havoc they were enjoying so much . Truth be told , I could use a hurricane like that around my house . <h> Wrought vs Wreaked <p> I mentioned earlier I had a good source to go against the conventional wisdom of the meaning of these two words . To tell you the truth , I always thought " wrought " and " wreaked " were interchangeable , at least in the context of havoc , but my source is rather better than the encyclopedia I carry around in my own head . My authority is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  get a posher source than that . So next time someone thinks they 're clever and tries to tell you that " wrought " is the wrong word to use with " havoc " or " chaos , " you can tell them they 're Grammar Nazis of the worst kind . That is , they 're the kind that 's altogether adamant about being grammatically wrong , and you can refer them to the Oxford Dictionary to make your point . <p> Moving on , there is a word that has nothing to do with havoc , but is often mistakenly used as such . <h> Wreak vs Reek : The very bad smell of havoc <p> " The air force bombers reeked havoc on our enemies " <p> Do you think the military has mastered the art of creating the worst ever stink bombs ? Or is it possible that our enemies smelled so strongly of havoc that our air force got a whiff of it ? I did n't  even know havoc had a smell . <p> You could say : <p> " The disgusting odor of the sewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But you could never say : <p> " Gosh that wreaks of ammonia ! " or " The wreak of the sewers was disgusting ! " <p> Well , I suppose you could write it if you wanted to , but it would be wrong , and everybody who reads it would know it was wrong . <p> Generally speaking , a bad odor " reeks " and can only " wreak " if it causes something else that is quite unpleasant to happen . <p> I 'm not a lover of text acronyms . here 's a true story . When I first began to use e-mail , people kept typing " LOL " in their responses . One day , I asked one of them what LOL actually meant , and they got back with " Laughs out loud ! " I must have been feeling a bit grouchy that day because I responded : " No need to be sarcastic , pal , just TELL me ! " <p> I kid you not . Since then , I have developed my own range of obscure text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like . Unless people have been writing to me , they will surely be baffled : <p> CHKL = chuckle <p> GGL = giggle <p> GFW = guffaw <p> TTR = titter <p> SNRT = snort <p> But were not here to discuss my off-the-wall , obscure text acronyms . Instead , well talk about the other kind the ones people use a whole lot . <p> GIGO = garbage in , garbage out . I think it may predate text speak , but I prefer the long form . Call me old-fashioned and see if I care . <p> ICYMI = in case you missed it . Yes . I missed it . If you had written that out in full , I would n't have . <p> ILY = I love you . Please slap anyone who cant be bothered to use the full form . Really ! <p> IMO = in my opinion . At least it does n't  even pretend to be humble . <p> IMHO = in my humble opinion , and believe me , its never humble . People who say " IMHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life . You can just tell someone is going to say something annoyingly patronizing when they use that one . <p> MSG = message . I always thought it stood for " monosodium glutamate . " See how ignorant I am ? <p> NP = no problem . Again , its infectious . The proper response would be LTT ( Learn to type another of my creations ) , but I 'm afraid Im one of the culprits . <p> OMG = oh my god . Guilty ! I even say " OMG " sometimes . Its invariably followed by a sense of self-loathing . <p> TMI = too much information . Well , if the phrase " too much information " is something you cant get your head around , no bloody wonder . <p> TTYL = talk to you later . OMG if you are going to TTML in that tone of acronym , I 'm not sure if I will handle it . <p> TX , THX or THKS = thanks . Now IMHO , if you 're going to use four of the six letters the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and include the two vowels . As for the X let 's not even go there ! #LTS = learn to spell ! <p> TXT = text . I do n't  think that saving one letter is worth it , but there it is . <p> Of course , this is just a broad sampling . Digits are ( unfortunately ) popular , particularly 4 ( for ) and 2 ( to ) , so we have 2nite , 2day , 2morrow , 4U , B4 , 4eva the hair on the back of my neck is rising , my nails are growing longer , a deep-throated growl is rising up from my belly . Aha ! H2O ! A sure-fire way to cool down . <p> But just try telling me " ILY 4eva " , and I swear , I 'll have a hissy fit that 's second to none and go looking for someone with more poetry in their soul and the ability to spell . FWIW its entirely possible I 'm the only one who does n't  think these things are cute which is why I am patronizing you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it , so perhaps you are also mystified by text abbreviations . <p> You may notice that I did n't  include favorites such as " WTF , " but I dislike excessive use of asterisks almost as much as I dislike text acronyms , so most of the acronyms containing the letter F have been excluded . I will leave them up to your imagination . <p> Oh wow ! That 's a tough question . It depends on a whole lot of things . At the same time , you shouldnt be intimidated. 1,000 words is actually a relatively short piece . A dissertation would usually be in the region of 12,000 words , and university assignments can stretch to essays of 5,000 words . No matter what your assigned word count may be , some of the things that will influence the time it takes to write the essay include : <h> How long does it take to research an essay ? <p> If you 're writing an opinion piece on something you already have some knowledge about , you may not have to do any research at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing thoughts into a coherent essay . If you need to find out about a topic before you begin to write , you can easily get information on certain topics , whilst others will be more obscure and therefore more difficult to research . Clearly , the easier it is to find information , the faster you can write . <h> How good are your reading comprehension skills ? <p> Some of us can just skim a piece and pick up all the salient points . Others will have to read with more attention , and even re-read a piece several times to extract the information we need . Having good reading and comprehension skills makes writing much faster since you 're able to " get " the facts faster and organize them better . Now you know why you had to do so many reading comprehension tests at school . <h> How well did you plan ? <p> Throwing yourself headlong at a 1,000-word essay and writing till you reach the word count may seem like the easy option , but it is n't . Planning your essay so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to make and then wraps everything up into a conclusion actually saves you time . Sometimes , essay instructions will tell you how to structure the piece , so read them carefully and extract any information you can use to guide your essays structure . <h> How fast do you type ? <p> Have you ever gotten lost halfway through a sentence ? You know what you wanted to say , but halfway through , the thought slips away from you . The faster you can type , the more easily you can capture thoughts before your mind moves onto the next thing and you forget what you were trying to say . Typing skills are essential in the modern world . Consider using typing games to improve your speed . <h> How long does it take me to write a 1,000-word essay ? <p> Faster is n't always better . The more in-depth your report is meant to be , the longer you should spend on it . I can usually research and write a fairly technical magazine article of 1,000 words in three hours , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I write all day , every day . <p> The longest Ive ever spent on a 1,000-word article was 12 hours . It was absolutely brutal ! The information I needed to gather was very technical , hard to find , and even more difficult to understand , and you cant write something until you really understand the subject matter . I also had to contact experts for their opinions , but I could n't even ask about their opinions until I could target them with the right questions . As a result , I actually had to write most of the article before slotting in the expert comment . <p> The quickest Ive ever written a 1,000-word article is one hour . In this case , I already knew the subject matter well and did n't  have to back up every fact in the essay with references . <h> Reviewing your work also matters <p> If you 're writing for grades and want a good one , you need a really good essay . Do n't  start writing it the day before you have to hand it in . Try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two before you have to submit your work . Then return to it and do your editing . Read your essay aloud to yourself , since this will help you pick up any careless errors you would n't otherwise spot . Check to see if your information flows logically from one point to the next and make sure that you 've presented your information clearly . <p> Remember , teachers get tired . They have to read the same kind of essay over and over again when they grade . If they struggle to understand what you 're saying , you might not get as good a grade as you would if you stuck to using short sentences and relatively simple language . <p> Your reviewing process shouldnt take all that long . If you do n't  have to make a lot of changes , you should be able to do your final edit in under half an hour . <p> Take your time . Whatever you do , do n't  rush . You might want your essay to be written quickly , but if its an important essay , taking your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time conservatively . Its better to find that you 've still got time left over than to run out of time and end up dashing things off with a looming deadline . <p> Below are some basic guidelines if you need a rough estimate on how long it will take to write an essay .

It takes about 166 hours and 40 minutes to write a 50,000 word essay . <p> Talk about opening a can of worms ! I initially though the answer to the question of the difference between " I look forward to hearing from you " and " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're interchangeable since both are absolutely correct English . A look around the Internet , however , tells me this minor difference in sentence structure causes quite a bit of controversy . Some say one is informal while the other is formal . Then there are others who say that actually , they see it the other way round and that the one that was declared " informal " is actually the one they consider " formal . " <h> Should This Bother You ? <p> Probably not . Nobody is going to brand you as illiterate because you choose one of these forms over the other as they both say basically the same thing . But if were going to enter the formal versus informal debate , I 'd side with those who say " I look forward to hearing from you " is the formal version and that 's not just because they seem to represent a majority and therefore the winning side ! <p> here 's why : if- you say " I am looking forward to hearing from you , " you have n't quite got the " balls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me , " I look forward to hearing from you " is a tiny bit clearer about who has to say something next . The former has a slightly greater nuance pointing towards how pleasant it would be to hear from someone , while the other is sharper , and the focus seems to be on the response you 're looking forward to getting . <p> Of course , that 's just my opinion . Authorities seem to disagree to disagree , and actually get quite heated arguing for one or the other . <h> Do Apostrophes Make Everything More Friendly ? <p> There are those who say " I am looking forward to hearing from you , " is still formal , whereas using the apostrophe to make " I am " contract into " I 'm " is the informal way of expressing the hope that someone is going to get back to them . <p> I expect most people will be ready to agree that contractions like " I 'm " are more informal than the full versions of the words . Again , I cant argue against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am " version places more emphasis on " looking forward . " <h> Getting It All Mixed-Up <p> Since these phrases are so similar in their meaning , some people mix up the tenses : " I am looking forward to hear from you , " is a common error . As soon as " look " gets an " ing " suffix , the next verb has to have an " ing " too . Thank goodness it does . English is confusing enough without mixing things up . <h> Nobody Can Quite Put a Finger on It <p> After browsing numerous articles , forums and other interesting places on the Internet , I came to this conclusion : most people agree that " I look forward to hearing " is more formal and urgent than " I am looking forward to hearing , " but none of them can quite say why . <p> Since there does n't  appear to be a definite answer to this question , what 's your opinion on it ? More specifically , why do you feel this way ? Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . <p> Due to the fact these two-word combinations sound exactly the same with only the placement of the apostrophe being different , many people are n't  sure which of them is correct . The aim of this article is to de-fog the fogginess surrounding these two ( we 've already done so with was vs were , further away vs farther away , and onto vs on to ) . One of these forms is correct , and the other is just plain wrong . Would anyone care to lay bets before we continue by explaining which is which ? <h> " Each " Refers to How Many ? <p> To get the answer were looking for , we should begin by looking at the word " each . " It automatically implies that we are talking about one of the following : a single object or person , a group of things , or people that can be regarded as a unit . <p> To put this more clearly , you would n't use a pluralized word after " each . " You may say " each animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " each animals have unique markings . " If you were to modify the sentence to " Each of the animals has unique markings , " were once again looking at a single animal at a time . <p> You could talk about " each people , " but then you would be talking about individual races , which turns the word " people " into a singular that could be pluralized as " peoples . " For example : " Each people has its own culture , " means that the French culture differs from the German culture , and so on . It would be a slightly odd way of expressing the idea , but it would n't be wrong because in the example " people " is singular . <p> The bottom line with all of this ? As soon as you see the word " each , " the word following it needs to be in its singular form . <h> " Other " Refers to How Many ? <p> Because we have prefixed " other " with " each " it has to remain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " other " which is " others , " it differs from the example of " people " since it has no alternative meaning and can not be pluralized yet again . <p> Returning to that example , we could say that " people " means a whole lot of persons , or we could use it to indicate race : " The Turks are a people who love their coffee . The Turks and the Greeks are two peoples who have often been at war . " There is no such alternative meaning for " others . " Its the plural form of " other " and that 's all there is to it . <h> Sticking to the Rule <p> The rule is that " each " will always be followed by a singular . " John and Mary promised to love each other forever . They agreed to take care of each others wellbeing above all else . " The apostrophe is used to indicate possession , and it comes before the s , not after it . <p> If we do n't  prefix " other " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural form . " You need to learn to respect others views , " but as soon as the magic " each " enters the equation , " You need to learn to respect each others views , " is the correct form . Do n't  be confused by the word " we , " even though it does indicate more than one person : " We need to learn to respect each others views " is correct as long as we use the singular forms of " other " after the word " each . " <h> Another Example <p> Here are two more permutations : " We need to respect one anothers views , " and " We need to respect others views . " <p> " One another " is really just another way of saying " Each other . " But if we leave out the word that indicates a singular ( " one " or " each " ) , we can use the apostrophe after the s because we are now talking about multiple others simultaneously . <h> No Need for Confusion <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and you 'll never get " each others " wrong again . Now , to the important business at hand . Who lost the bet I invited you to make at the beginning of this piece ? I accept PayPal , wire transfers , and indentured servitude as methods of payment <p> Sometimes , we come across words we do n't  understand when we are reading a passage . You could just google the word to see what it means , but if you 're in certain situations , such as an exam room , you are n't  going to be able to do that . Besides , being able to work out what a word means all on your own is much more rewarding . <p> To do this , you can either look at the word itself , trying to break down the components into bits you think you understand , or you can look at context . Context is the setting in which you find the word and reading context clues are the bits of information you can pick up about an unknown word from the surrounding context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and see if you can find the context clues that will help you to understand it . <p> here 's an example of context clues at work : <p> " As the king entered his throne room , obsequious attendants bowed before him while keeping an eye out for anything he might need . Each wanted to be the first to provide any service , real or imagined , that his highness might want . " <p> They were also very attentive . They wanted to be the first to provide any service . <p> Already , the meaning of the word is starting to take shape . These people are almost overly attentive to their masters needs . They are using exaggerated types of conduct to demonstrate how important they think their king is . Could this be the meaning of " obsequious ? " Let 's go to the dictionary definition . <p> " Obedient or attentive to an excessive or servile degree . " <p> Alright , our understanding of the word was n't quite as succinct as that , but its still correct . <p> Oh no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? Let 's look at the context . We discussed the meaning of a definition at length . Then we found the dictionary definition , and it was rather brief by comparison . Context clues are at work . What 's the definition of " succinct ? " Is it something short ? <p> " Briefly or clearly expressed " <p> Ta-dah ! My erudition knows no limits ! I am so clever that I might even call myself a genius . <p> Noooo ! Another seldomly-used word has appeared on the scene . What is the context ? You can certainly see I was pleased with my own cleverness . Clues following the word include the words " clever " and " genius . " Could I be patting myself on the back for being too clever by half ? Let 's check : <p> " The quality of having or showing great learning ; scholarship . " Yup ! I was being insufferably pleased with my own smarts . <p> This time , I 've left very few clues . However , I have just bragged like crazy . I 've also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smarts . " How do we normally feel about people who are ridiculously self-satisfied ? Its irritating , is n't it ? Let 's check . <p> " Not to be endured , intolerable , unbearable " <p> That was pretty close , was n't it ? <h> Check Words Both Before and After to Get Context <p> What ideas led up to the unfamiliar word ? What ideas followed it ? Its just like being a crime-scene investigator . Just looking at what 's happening before the word may not give you the full context , and the same thing goes for just looking at the words that follow it . Sometimes , the clues happen before the fact . Sometimes they appear after the fact , and sometimes , theyll be in both places . <h> A Little Knowledge Is a Dangerous Thing <p> There 's just one problem with playing detective using context clues . You could be wrong . Its also possible to be almost right without quite being wrong , but unfortunately " almost right " is n't always good enough . <p> Although context clues can be extremely helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant check a dictionary or search online , you should make a note of the new word and check it later to see if you understood it correctly . If your context clues helped you get it right , you 're going to feel good . If you almost got it right , you 'll be reasonably pleased , and if you got it all wrong ( an unlikely scenario , but a possible one nonetheless ) you 'll have learned something new . <h> Extra Context Clue Tips <p> Look for synonyms ( words that mean the same thing ) <p> " I was remorseful and sorry . " <p> Look for antonyms ( opposites ) <p> " I was ecstatic , but everyone else was miserable . " <p> Look for words that define or explain the idea <p> " Tangible evidence the footprints at the window , the fingerprints on the knife helped police to catch the culprit . " <p> A normal verb is just one word : go , see , eat or cry . However , a phrasal verb is formed by a phrase of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words : the verb and its particle , which often looks like a preposition but is n't . <h> Particles Do n't  Just Occur in Physics <p> For example , " count on " is phrasal , but " on " is not a preposition in this context . Its a particle . Why ? Because if I say , " I can count on you every day , " I am not saying that I use your body to do my counting not unless were really close friends and like to do silly things together . So when " on " is paired with " count , " a new meaning is created . The phrasal verb is actually an idiom , a special way of expressing an idea that is not literal . <p> The meaning of this sentence should be clear . I am stating that you are reliable and trustworthy , and every day I know what to expect from you . That 's what " count on " indicates . <p> Another phrasal verb is " break up . " If you look at the literal meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break an object into pieces . But when you use the words as a phrasal verb , you create a new meaning : <p> " I broke up with my girlfriend after 10 years because she wanted to marry a rich guy . " <p> Poor me and yes , I really am poor because she preferred a man with lots of money . Can you see what I 'm saying here ? I ended my relationship ; I " broke up " the boyfriend-girlfriend bond . This is a very common usage of " break up " ( and its in the past tense because it already occurred ) . But its not the only meaning of this verb . See this example : <p> " The students broke up when their teacher spilled milk all over his shiny new suit . " <p> What do you think they did ? Did they rush to help him clean it off ? Did they feel sad ? No way : not those cruel students . They laughed ! So here 's a second meaning of " break up . " Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see it , especially in American English . Since the two meanings are very different , its easy to tell which one is being used from the context its in . With a little experience , you can get used to phrasal verbs with multiple definitions . <h> Can You See the Phrasal Verb in This Sentence ? <p> " I got away with looking in my textbook for answers while I took- the test . " <p> Is it " got away " ? Not quite . The phrasal verb is actually " got away with , " so it has three parts . Occasionally , you will see a phrasal such as this , but as stated above , they are generally two words . This is a great example of how to use " got away with , " because it means to do something ( that 's not very good ) without being caught or punished . At the same time , this is not a recommended action . I am clearly a lazy student who does n't  want to study . I promise to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want to run into him by accident at the concert . " <p> " Let 's shop around to see which computer gives us the best value . " <p> Did you see the phrasal verb in the first sentence ? It is " run into . " Its simple to identify it . However , the second sentence has three verbs : " shop , " " to see " and " gives . " Wheres the phrasal one ? It must be " shop around . " Its the only one with a particle . " To see " is an infinitive . If you reverse it and write " see to , " you have another phrasal verb . So to identify a phrasal verb , always look for the verb first and the particle second ( and third , in some cases ) . <p> Have you ever wondered why people say and write " congradulations " to those graduating instead of congratulations ? What we have here is a pun or play on words . Whoever first dreamed this one up must have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did too since it has caught on in a big way . " Grad , " of course , is short for " graduate , " and it sounds vaguely similar to the " grat " part of the word " congratulations . " Saying or writing " congradulations " is , therefore , an attempt at a mild joke . <p> I 'm not sure if anyone finds this particular play on words " punny " ( funny ) any more . Even though I am told that I have an unhealthy love of puns , it fails to elicit so much as a smirk . I 'd class most puns as " groan " humor , and " congradulations " has become so overused it does n't  even give rise to that . <p> A little recourse to Google is all it takes for me to see that people are starting to get irritated about the use of " congradulations . " There are even rants that fiercely declare its time everyone went back to saying " congratulations " like proper English-speakers . I 'd say its corny , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulations " is n't really spelled like that . <h> The Art of the Pun , Play on Words or Paronomasia <p> The formal term for a " pun " is " paronomasia . " If you learn nothing else from this article , you 'll at least have found a wonderful new Scrabble word that will have your friends reaching for the dictionary . <p> In the interest of finding a pun that tickles your funny bone , I 'm going to see if I can come up with a few classics that will either make you smile or form the intention of throwing a dictionary at me should we ever chance to meet in person . Pay careful attention , and you may even discover how to develop a few puns of your own . But be warned some find puns witty and cute , while others will not . Its always important to get ready to duck at possible flying objects aimed in your direction as you utter your newly coined pun . <h> A Lot of Jokes Use Puns in Their Punchlines <p> As you go through this selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . If that happens , you 'll know what I mean by " groan " humor , but it may also become more difficult to understand just why I like puns so much . Are you ready ? <p> Q : Why are pirates called " pirates " ? <p> A : Because they Arrrr . <p> Q : What do you call a very energetic person who constantly used puns ? <p> A : An energizer punny . <p> Q : What did the calm leaf say to the trembling one ? <p> A : What 's stomata ? <p> As with our " congradulations " example , these puns use similar sounding words that are nonetheless very different from the ones they masquerade as , but that 's not always the case . Read on for even more painful wordplay . <p> " He is n't all that fond of cooking Indian food , but he does like currying favor . " <p> " I see you have a photographic memory . Too bad you never developed it . " <p> " If we can say one thing about boiled eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two antennas got married . The wedding was n't exciting , but the reception was fantastic ! " <p> " If you fail to pay an exorcist , you may be repossessed . " <p> This variety of pun is my favorite . I feel particularly pleased with myself when I coin a new one , and when I hear puns like this , I may even smile , snort , giggle , titter , laugh or even guffaw . Then again , I 'm slightly strange that way . Do you have a favorite pun or play on words ? If so , please share it by adding your comment . Do you hate puns ?

Why would you want to create a random name for anything or anyone or even for yourself ? Its strange but true : you may well find the need to come up with a random name at some time in your life . There 's a good chance you have made your way to this article because you 're in search of a random name for some specific reason , and its not because you 're about to commit a crime at least , we hope not ! The best way to find a random name is through a random name generator . Here are some of the reason you may want to come up with random names : <h> You 're a writer <p> You may have already decided on names for your leading men and leading ladies , but what about your supporting cast of characters ? You cant call them all " John Doe " or " Jane Doe " . Looking at random names can help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have ever considered on your own . <h> You need a pen name <p> There are a lot of reasons why writers choose to adopt a nom de plume . You could be writing on a controversial subject and want to avoid getting hate-mail from those who do n't  agree with you , or you could be writing in several genres and want your readers to associate different author names with each of these . Whatever you reasons , a random name may be just what you need . <h> You need an online persona <p> Participating in online forums and discussions is an innocent activity , but all too many people find they are targeted by trolls or stalked by sickos who make scary threats . Whether they are actually able to deliver on these is questionable , but it can be scary when you 're using your real name . They could track you down on social media and find out where you work or even find ways to trace your physical address . Are you scared yet ? Use an online name instead . <h> You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many websites require signup details including your name and email address .

The results could include identity theft , so its no wonder that many choose fake names for website signups . <h> Testing things out <p> When you need good test data , using your own or someone elses information could result in some very real hassles for you . The solution ? A fake identity that you use just to check that everything works as it should . <h> Getting naming ideas for babies or pets <p> Although most of us have ideas about what wed like to name our kids , our partners may not agree .

If your name is Chris Crummey , it may seem that stardom will forever be beyond you . If you were to achieve fame despite your moniker , the jokes would be intolerable . That 's why Chris Crummey of the rock band Deep Purple chose the stage name Chris Curtis . Its way less crummy ( with apologies to Chris ) . <h> Your names taken <p> Performing arts guilds are all too ready to take up cudgels against those who seek fame under the name of an existing member .

Your parents ended up naming you , but if you could name yourself , what would that be ? Going through a list of random names can help you pick the name you would have chosen for yourself . <h> 3 comments <p> I like to look at random names and imagine what a person with a name would be like .

This essay differs from your first college essay , because it has slightly less of a focus on your personality . Why do you have to write this essay ? There is no secret answer . The college wants to know why you 're motivated to attend that particular school rather than just carrying on at your current one . <h> What 's Your Reason ? <p> " I hate my current college , " is definitely not a good answer . You should never say anything negative about your current school . Chances are , you have valid reasons for a transfer even if you werent quite happy , and its important to highlight these rather than complain . <p> For example , class sizes at your current school might have been too big , so your professors were unable to pay any attention to your needs . Do n't  voice the criticism . Instead , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , more tightly-knit classes in X College , and I believe I would benefit from the enhanced opportunity for interaction with teachers and fellow students .

Maybe you 've been studying out of town but would like to be nearer to old friends and family , or you might have fallen in love with a certain college because the professors are famous experts in their field . <p> The reasons why you think going to a new college is likely to be a good move will probably take up quite a lot of your essay , but even if your reasons are simple , they should be clearly written , be positive , and be valid .

If you found a subject confusing or difficult , or you lost your cool in the exam room and blanked out , say so . Then explain what you have done to overcome the problem . This shows you 're determined to succeed , and you wo n't let anything stand in your way . <h> What Are Your Objectives ? <p> When we have just graduated from high school , we often are n't  quite sure what we want to do with our lives .

@@12747239 @1347239/ <h> Other Words for " Said " <p> Direct speech can be difficult to smoothly navigate when you 're writing , but if you 're writing a novel or short story , dialogue is almost certainly going to happen at some point . When there is a conversation , the most common thing to do is use " said " when a person speaks : <p> " Are you crazy ? " said Mary . <p> " Some of the time , " said John . <p> " Well , " said Mary , " I wish you would give me some warning before you do things like that ! " <p> " I 'll try , " said John . <p> Then Mary leaned in close and said , " Oh shucks ! I love you anyway ! " <p> That 's a whole lot of " said " right there , and it gets repetitive pretty fast , does n't  it ? It becomes essential to have alternatives for the word " said " if you want your writing to sound decent . There are several ways this can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> If a conversation involves two people ( dialogue ) , your reader will quickly see the two people are talking . That means that you can introduce your speakers , and then continue the conversation without saying who said what on the assumption your reader will be able to work out who is speaking , at least for a few lines . <h> Describe Actions Before or After the Quotation Marks <p> For example : " Oh shucks ! I love you anyway ! " Mary cuddled closer with a sigh . <p> In our example , we can clearly see Mary was doing the talking . If John says something next , hell get a new paragraph to himself , emphasizing the change of speaker . Voila ! Conundrum avoided . " Saying " words have been completely skipped , but we still know who was talking . <h> Use Words Other than " Said " <p> Depending on context , there are a whole bunch of alternative words for " said " we can choose .

Was Mary objecting to Johns actions in a good-humored , frightened or angry way ? Your choice of words can tell your reader what her tone of voice was . <p> And when she told John she loved him anyway , was she feeling romantic or amused ? Did she blurt it out unexpectedly , or was she being coy and flirtatious ? How did John feel when he responded to her initial protestation ? Was he serious or light-hearted ? <h> Changing Moods <p> Look at how these words change the mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sobbed Mary . <p> " Some of the time , " muttered John . <p> " Well , " Mary complained , " I wish you would give me some warning before you do things like that ! " <p> " I 'll try , " John promised . <p> Then Mary leaned in close and murmured , - " Oh shucks ! I love you anyway ! " <p> You should have gained a sense of how the person speaking felt by the way they said it . Now see how changing the " talking " words can change the entire scene : <p> " Are you crazy ? " giggled Mary . <p> " Some of the time , " chuckled John . <p> " Well , " Mary laughed , " I wish you would give me some warning before you do things like that !

Its not a matter of being struck by lightning or having the muse whisper ideas into your ear . The truth is , ideas are everywhere .

If you can do that , you 'll never be without an idea for stories , articles , and other projects . Here are fifty-three sources of ideas to get you started . <h> Books <p> Good writers read widely .

Its a great way to find ideas . <h> Exercise <p> Exercise relaxes your mind and gives you time to think . If you exercise outside , you can combine some nature watching with your exercise . If you 're in a gym , throw in some people watching and eavesdropping . Or just tune it all out and let your subconscious surprise you . <h> Pressure <p> Some people crumble under deadlines , but others thrive . Sometimes there 's nothing like knowing you have to produce an article or story to get the ideas flowing . True story : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote the night before the deadline . I 'd put it off and put it off and finally decided to sit down and write . I was stumped for a while but then I just started with the first crazy thing that came into my head . I do n't  recommend living a life that 's stressed out all of the time but sometimes a little pressure can get you moving when nothing else can . <h> Writers groups <p> Your writing colleagues may be able to help you come up with an idea , or the act of simply hanging out with them may generate an idea . <h> Book clubs <p> Not only are you reading , but you 're discussing what you read with others . Hearing how other people experience the book may give you an idea or a new way of seeing the material that can be spun off into your own work . <h> Newspapers/TV News <p> Read the headlines to see what 's happening . Read the ads , the comics , and the lifestyle section , as well . You never know when something will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers on microfilm , trawl through those . Televised news can also be a source of ideas . Everything from the headlines to the anchors themselves becomes fair game . <h> Journaling <p> Writing down the events of the day , working through a problem , ranting about your boss , or just jotting down your random thoughts will sometimes yield an idea you would n't have thought of otherwise . Just remember to keep the journal private . Blogs are good for some things , but posting your most intimate , uncensored , and damaging thoughts is n't one of them . <h> Dreams <p> Its funny what our subconscious serves up at night . A lot of it makes no sense , but every once in a while you get a dream ( or part of a dream ) that 's the idea for a great story . <h> Blue Sky <p> Disney has a process called " Blue Sky . " This is where everyone involved in a project ( and even some who are not involved like the janitors ) are asked to simply throw ideas into the mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far-fetched , or expensive is written down and considered . No one is allowed to say , " That wo n't work , " on the first pass . Most ideas are eventually discarded , but some ( or combinations of some ) work out and go on to become movies or attractions . Have your own " Blue Sky " time and just write down every crazy thing that comes into your head . When you go back and read it , you might be surprised at what you find . <h> Get out of your rut <p> Ruts make it difficult for us to see new things . Try driving to work a different way , take a new route for your evening walk , eat at a new restaurant , or go somewhere you would n't normally choose . Just do something different and see if you get new ideas . <h> Pinterest/collages <p> The ideas here come from looking at interesting combinations of things you might not have thought of . Why is someone showcasing jam jars with vampires ? <h> Freewriting <p> This is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the events of your life , per se . You start with a prompt or something that just pops into your head and write whatever comes to mind . Or , you could start with a question about a current project or something that you want to know . Write for ten or fifteen minutes without censoring yourself and then see what you 've got . <h> Historical research <p> History is full of fun facts and events that can be used for stories and articles . Many things are well known , but its often the overlooked things and people , or the events that get one line mentions in books that are the most fun to think about . <h> Memories/personal experience <p> Where better to get ideas than from your own personal experience ? Maybe you write about your high school boyfriend , or the time your neighbor pissed you off . <h> Daydreams <p> Staring out the window and daydreaming can be a valid way to get an idea . It relaxes your brain and you often think about things that are n't  terribly realistic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we often turn off the censor in our minds which leads to ideas flowing more freely . <h> Ask , " What if ? " <p> This is the best question to ask when looking for ideas . Take any situation , experience , or product and ask , " What if ? " Then fill in the blank with whatever crazy thing you want . <h> Fix a problem or address a need <p> Ever said to yourself , " If only this product did insert feature . " Or , " Wouldnt it be neat if I could do insert ability or problem fix . " Or , " I really need insert need here , but it does n't  exist . " Sure , your solution could be really out there , but that 's where the story begins . <h> Mash up ideas <p> Things that at first seem like they have no relation to each other can sometimes be made to fit together in a new and interesting way . Look at the people who put Pride and Prejudice together with Zombies . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads . <h> Re-read your old work <p> Maybe there 's something there you did n't  explore fully the first time , or you see a new way you can slant it to appeal to new markets . <h> Talk to strangers <p> Chat up the shopkeeper or the guy changing your oil . Talk to the guy who fixes your furnace or your favorite librarian . You do n't  have to become best friends , but you never know when a fascinating story or idea will come out of their experience . <h> Attend an event <p> Go to a conference or seminar . Better yet , go to one that covers a topic or industry with which you have no experience . You might see a whole different world and way of thinking that opens your mind . <h> Newsletters <p> Newsletters can be good sources for keeping up with trends , following events in a field , or just getting bits of gossip that are fun to read . Subscribe to newsletters from a variety of fields and interests . <h> Statistics <p> Numbers do n't  lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or they can be manipulated by various groups to gain support for their causes . Whenever you see a statistic , stop and think about what it means , who benefits from this statistic , and how you might work it into a story or article . <h> Take the opposite position <p> Whenever you encounter an article or real life situation , try taking the opposite position . They say yes , you say no . They say good idea , you say bad idea . They say , " They lived happily ever after , " you say , " And they died in complete misery . " <h> Take a class <p> Classes not only teach you new things , they expose you to new people and new ways of looking at the world . Pick something you want to know ( or that your character wants to know ) and take a class on the subject . <h> Learn something new <p> The age old advice for writers is to " write what you know . " But the best articles and story ideas often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask yourself , " What do I want to know ? " and then go learn about it . <h> Read your junk mail <p> Yes , most of it is pure garbage . But every now and then you get a piece with an interesting statistic , a cause you 've never heard of before , or a political appeal that 's so far " out there " that you wonder where these people come from . <h> Be somebody else for a while <p> The old saying that you do n't  know about someone elses experience until you 've walked a mile in their shoes is true . Do manual labor instead of working your cushy desk job . Spend a day in a wheelchair or wearing a blindfold to see how hard it is to be disabled . Immerse yourself in the conservative political rhetoric instead of the liberal , or vice versa . Spend some time in someone elses shoes and see how it changes your outlook on things . <h> Ask what happens next <p> Say that a police car blows by you at 90 MPH , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are choppers overhead , too . Think about what they could be responding to and where the story goes from there . Whenever you see something interesting happening in the world around you , ask what happens next . <h> Social media <p> Its the ultimate source for keeping up with tends , reading about peoples lives , seeing interesting pictures , and hearing the best gossip . Its a petri dish of ideas . <h> Hobbies <p> Your hobbies might introduce you to new people , places , or ways of thinking . If your hobbies tend to be solitary like reading or knitting , see if you can join a club or go to classes to broaden your horizons . <h> Finish the story <p> So , you watched a movie or read a book and then wondered what happened to the characters after the end . Continue the story . This is the basis for fan fiction , but it can also be lead to something that you can turn into your own story . Not to mention there is a whole industry these days that takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their characters into something else . <h> Play like a kid <p> When we become adults , we often stop playing . But its during play that some of the best ideas can come out . Remember when you were a kid ? Youd start with a game , or maybe something like playing house and then it would evolve into something else as you went along . That tree became the enemy castle . The creek became a mighty river that swallowed your settlers . ( Or it held a giant crocodile . ) Or your dolls were suddenly living in opulence in the mansion you set up under the dining room table . GI Joe was getting along great with Barbie and they were raising a herd of Star Wars Action figures . Kids are great at creating things on the fly because they do n't  stop to say , " Thats not believable . " They just go with it . <h> Religion <p> Religious texts are full of stories and allegories that can become ideas for other things . I 'm not saying that you should devalue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . How many stories are similar to the fall of Adam and Eve , or to the trials of Job , for example ? <h> Re-write history <p> How many books on the market today took a real life event and then re-imagined the outcome ? It does n't  even have to be a well known historical event . You can take an event from your own life and imagine that it turned out differently . <h> Take something ordinary to the extreme <p> Much of what we see and do everyday is fairly boring . But what if you took something ordinary and took it to the extreme ? ( In your head , only , please . No matter how much you want to kill your neighbor , do it on the page , not in real life . ) What would happen if , instead of stopping at that stoplight , you ran it and got chased by cops and ended up in a ditch and then running for your life ? What if , instead of kowtowing politely to your boss you told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas can be found in cutting edge scientific research . Some of it is already pretty far out there and you can use your imagination to take it even further or to consider the consequences of such research . You can also do a few experiments yourself to see what happens . ( Just do n't  blow up your house . ) <h> Check the calendar <p> There are always holidays , observances , and tribute months coming up . Think about what happens on these days or during these time periods and ask how you can make one of them relevant to your audience . Or ask what would happen to a character who 's observing one of these holidays and something goes wrong . Or ask why the character is participating in a holiday activity . <h> Look at objects <p> Really take the time to study that glass or coffee table . Study that building or train . We see so many things every day but we rarely really look at them . Who knows what you might see in everyday objects . <h> Quotes <p> I recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was based on one of Eleanor Roosevelts quotes . " Do one thing every day that scares you , " prompted the author to spend a year doing exactly that . <h> Eavesdrop <p> Like people watching , listening to their conversations can be fascinating . Do n't  listen where you are n't  supposed to , but if someone is having a full volume conversation in a restaurant or yelling into their cell phone at the park , tune in to what they 're saying . The situation might be ripe for a story . <p> Remember that the idea is only a small part of the creative process and its actually the easiest part . Everyone has ideas , and a lot of people have the same ideas . And some ideas , in their original form , are too silly , incomplete , or nonsensical to become stories . Its what you do with the idea that matters . What matters most is that you do something with the ideas you get . A notebook full of great ideas is n't worth anything until you put them on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read . <h> 5 comments <p> I 'm not sure what the point of this story is . Its pretty generalized and commonsense , no ? <p> If you 're suggesting inspiration for writing for a living , then casting about for random interesting things to write about is going about it the wrong way . If you 're interested in writing for a specific publication , website or other outlet , then you need to study that website/publication to get an understanding of what types of writing they typically publish . What are the topics , what 's the typical length . Study the writing style of the various authors . By doing this you 'll have a more accurate idea of what a given publication is looking for rather than randomly proposing some topic out of the blue . Pick up The Writers Market or another annually updated resource for writers that consolidates information on thousands of possible outlets for writers . Professional writers do n't  just write about things they think up . They do actual research on a given topic so they can truly add value to the content they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create unique ideas for your writing .

For anyone who is n't , but who wants to increase the amount of writing they 're producing , there 's no better time to begin than at this moment . Over the next month , I will document my 1000 words a day challenge . 1000 words a day is a great goal for any writer who wants to begin getting into the habit of writing on a daily basis . As part of the challenge , I will explain some of the methods Ive developed over the years , and I hope others who are also doing this challenge ( or who have done a similar challenge in the past ) , will contribute their insights and tips to the conservation as well . <p> As I explained in a previous article , there are a number of steps anyone who decides to take up a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . Doing so will make it more likely the challenge is completed . Here are my answers to each step : <p> Step one : How many words will I write each day ? 1000 . <p> Step two : What 's the minimum number of words I must write each day ? 100 . <p> Step three : How long will the challenge be ? One month ( during October ) . <p> Step four : Will there be any off days ? No . <p> Step five : How will I let others know about the challenge to keep myself honest ? I will be doing this by recording it on this blog throughout the month . <p> Step six : How will I keep track and record my daily word count throughout the challenge ? I will do it here on this blog . <p> If Im successful with the challenge , I will have written a minimum of 31,000 words by the end of the month . Going by past experience , even if I do n't  reach the goal , I should write more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue it for the entire 31 days . That 's a vitally important point for all these challenges .

@@12747243 @1347243/ <h> How to Write a Review <p> There are numerous places where you 're only expected to leave a brief comment when you write a review . For example , an Amazon review consists of allocating a star rating and writing anything from a couple of words : " Great product ! " to a couple of paragraphs to explain just why you think the product or vendor is or is n't great . You can say whatever you like . Nobodys going to expect a structured review article . They just want to know if you think the product is any good or not , and your opinion allows them to compare reviews with those- of others . <p> If , however , you want to write a more serious review on a book , movie or product , you 'll be writing a full article , and that means you need to apply some sort of structure . There are no hard and fast rules , and you may be limited to some degree as many times reviews will have word count limits , but this is how I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Are Reviewing <p> Your reader wants to know exactly what you are reviewing . If its a book or a movie , theyd like to know whether previous efforts by the same author or movie maker were well-received . If its a product , theyll want to know what the product is , who made it , and perhaps some historical background on the manufacturers or their products . <p> Remember , you know what you 're reviewing because you 've seen it , heard it , tasted it , touched it , used it , or otherwise consumed it in whatever form its intended to be consumed . Your reader does n't  . Provide readers with the information they need about the item you 're reviewing in your very first paragraph . <p> In some cases , particularly when you 're reviewing a product , telling your reader why you felt the need to buy it can also help . Give your " why " before or after your " what . " Now your reader will know what you are talking about and what need the item fulfills . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there are some things you 'll review that do n't  have a single good thing about them , that 's pretty rare . For example , a book I recently read was based on a puerile premise and was packed with plot cliches , but the style in which it was written was actually rather good . <p> For the sake of getting to the point , I usually begin with whatever made the biggest impression . In my example , I 'd kick off with the things that annoyed me about the book . Giving reasons for your opinion helps your reader to decide whether the things you did or did n't  like would be the kind of things they identify with . For example : " With its focus on cliched , pulp fiction plotlines that are so full of holes you could use them as a colander , xxx book turned out to be an annoying read . I felt the reader wasnt being credited with intelligence and the author was n't really trying . " <p> But it would n't be fair to only give my opinion on the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with : " The authors writing style is nevertheless beautiful the only reason why I persevered with the story all the way through to its unsurprising ending . " <h> What Could Make It More Acceptable to You ? <p> Even when you 're reviewing something you really like , there 's usually room for some kind of improvement . At the risk of annoying its many fans , I could say that the book War and Peace is a trifle too long , for example . After all , a review is an expression of opinions , and you or I can have any opinions we like as long as we can back them up with information . Using my silly book ( not War and Peace ) as an example , I would probably say : " If the same author could come up with a more original and less sentimental plotline instead of rehashing a formula , I 'd be very interested in seeing the result . " <h> Sum It All Up <p> Lazy readers , which is to say most people , will read your opening paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you actually did arrive at a conclusion . This paragraph briefly sums up the main points you 've highlighted and may end with a call to action such as " Boycott this hotel ! " or " Try it for yourself , I think you 'll love it as much as I did . " <h> More Serious Reviews <p> Most reviews follow the structure we 've discussed above . If you 're being asked for a subjective opinion , you can back it up by describing how you arrived at it , but sometimes you have to write a " literature review . " This means you have to track down all the published literature you can find on a certain topic and piece it together with references so that you can draw a coherent conclusion that is supported by the accepted academic works you 've discovered . Its much harder to do , and its nevertheless not as daunting as you might think , but that 's a topic for a future article . <h> 3 comments <p> Is it really all that complicated to write a review ?

@@12747244 @1347244/ <h> Month : June 2016 <p> Since there is such a lot of confusion about homonyms ( words that are pronounced in the same way but spelled differently such as wether , weather and whether ) , its time to allot the task of explaining this trio to you . That last sentence may already have explained the difference between allot and a lot quite economically , but let 's have some fun with our words and also get around to alot . <h> Spoken and Informal English <p> When we speak , we seldom think about the individual words we use as much as we think about the phrases . So when you say " How are you ? you probably chose the whole phrase out of your mental linguistic archives rather than thinking about every word . Its almost as if your brain sees the phrase as a word in itself . <p> When we say phrases like this , we often run the words together so that they almost sound like one word , and that 's where a lot of English errors have their origin . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use English to write informally , we sometimes lump words together , even when they do n't  really belong together . Alot is one of these , and under current English rules , its really incorrect . People use it to say a lot , and although some argue that the contraction without the space is n't a big deal and may be accepted as correct English at some time in the future , it is n't correct today . <p> If alot does ever become an accepted form , it will be strictly informal . Other lumped together words that are accepted in informal writing are gon na and wan na , but you definitely wont be using them in a business letter or school assignment . <p> To avoid confusing your friends , a lot is definitely the way to go , and it means exactly the same thing its the opposite of a little bit . So I hope you have learned a lot already , and that you wont be using alot in future . <h> What Does " Allot " Mean ? <p> Returning to our introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explaining this trio to you " So obviously , I am using the word to describe giving a task . I could also say : " Reading my essay on How to Write a College Admissions Essay is your allotted task for today . " Or I might say " I am allotting you the task of , " or " I allot you the task of " <p> So I can use the word " allot " to share out tasks or work . I could also use it to describe something else that well share : " Of the $50 we earned at our lemonade stand , I 'll allot $10 to you for your help " . Its possible Im being a little greedy with my profits and keeping the lions share , but at least I am sharing . " Allot " is a verb , but it can be turned into a noun , by adding " ment " to the end . Now we have a noun describing a thing that is shared , so an " allotment " is usually someones piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shared between several people . An easy trick to remembering this is that " allot " indicates some kind of sharing , and sharing requires at least two people " allot " has two ls . <p> " Allot " is quite a formal word , so youd usually use the word " share " when you 're talking to friends about dividing up a pizza or the costs of a fun trip . Its also perfectly correct to use " share " in most formal contexts , so if you 're not quite sure about when it would be appropriate to use " allot " use " share " instead , and you cant really go wrong . <h> Spell Check Pitfalls <p> My computer does n't  like it when I use alot . Every time I type it , auto correct shoves the space in there , and I have to go back and fix it . Once I 've done that , spell check underlines it in red showing me that its a mistake . But if I were to type the word " allot " and drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the same thing . I 'd mean " allot " but get " a lot " , and thered be no indication from spell check that my work contained any mistakes to speak of . That 's just one example that illustrates the need for careful proofreading even when you have spell check to help you . <p> You 're you , and you 're quite happy that way . Why would you want to create a random name for anything or anyone or even for yourself ? Its strange but true : you may well find the need to come up with a random name at some time in your life . There 's a good chance you have made your way to this article because you 're in search of a random name for some specific reason , and its not because you 're about to commit a crime at least , we hope not ! The best way to find a random name is through a random name generator . Here are some of the reason you may want to come up with random names : <h> You 're a writer <p> You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading ladies , but what about your supporting cast of characters ? You cant call them all " John Doe " or " Jane Doe " . Looking at random names can help you come up with the perfect character name which you may not have ever considered on your own . <h> You need a pen name <p> There are a lot of reasons why writers choose to adopt a nom de plume . You could be writing on a controversial subject and want to avoid getting hate-mail from those who do n't  agree with you , or you could be writing in several genres and want your readers to associate different author names with each of these . Whatever you reasons , a random name may be just what you need . <h> You need an online persona <p> Participating in online forums and discussions is an innocent activity , but all too many people find they are targeted by trolls or stalked by sickos who make scary threats . Whether they are actually able to deliver on these is questionable , but it can be scary when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on social media and find out where you work or even find ways to trace your physical address . Are you scared yet ? Use an online name instead . <h> You do n't  want to give away any personal information <p> So many websites require signup details including your name and email address . Before you know it , you 're receiving spam from people wanting to sell you fake pharmaceuticals and goodness knows what else . Although reputable sites do try to keep your details private , that information could be hacked . The results could include identity theft , so its no wonder that many choose fake names for website signups . <h> Testing things out <p> When you need good test data , using your own or someone elses information could result in some very real hassles for you . The solution ? A fake identity that you use just to check that everything works as it should . <h> Getting naming ideas for babies or pets <p> Although most of us have ideas about what wed like to name our kids , our partners may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names could present you with some new ideas you had n't  previously considered . As for pets well , any idea is better than no idea , right ? <h> Your given name is difficult <p> Have you ever dealt with clients in China ? You 'll find that theyve all got names like Vicky and Simon . Are they hiding there real names for devious reasons ? No , they are being courteous . They understand that you may have trouble pronouncing their names , and have chosen something you 'll find easier to identify with . <h> A fake name to hide a crummy real name <p> We cant overlook stage names in this list of reasons for adopting or using a random name . If your name is Chris Crummey , it may seem that stardom will forever be beyond you . If you were to achieve fame despite your moniker , the jokes would be intolerable . That 's why Chris Crummey of the rock band Deep Purple chose the stage name Chris Curtis . Its way less crummy ( with apologies to Chris ) . <h> Your names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up cudgels against those who seek fame under the name of an existing member . Have you ever wondered what the J stands for in the name Michael J. Fox ? It stands for nothing . Its just there because another , less famous actor with a guild membership was already named Michael Fox . But what if your name already matches that of a famous person ? You might not want to be associated with the singer Michael Jackson just because that 's your name . A random name might suit you better . <h> You just like the sound of it <p> Sometimes its just nice to have a name on hand that you use from time to time because you like the sound of it . Your parents ended up naming you , but if you could name yourself , what would that be ? Going through a list of random names can help you pick the name you would have chosen for yourself . <p> The mysteries of punctuation are myriad , and they often come out when you are writing an essay . Where should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a semi-colon , and should you capitalize your first letter after one of these full-stop hybrids ? <p> For those looking for a quick and dirty answer , a word is not capitalized after a colon . A word is not capitalized after a semi-colon as well . There are , however , a few exceptions . If the word that comes after a colon or semi-colon is a proper name , you definitely would capitalize it . " Alice " remains capitalized , and so does " Missouri " , but north would not . In addition , if you 're quoting someone after a colon , they open their speech or text with a capital letter . The rest of the time , its lower case . To put it slightly differently , you are n't  starting a new sentence when you use a colon or semi-colon , so you would only use capitals in the places you ordinarily would . <h> Semi-Colons <p> Semi-colons are the more confusing of the two for most , so well begin here . The reason why they may make you wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the way they 're used . <p> " I walked into the shop . Everything was on sale , so I bought a lot . " <p> The two sentences are closely related , and they 're a bit choppy when they 're as short as this . So you might put a semi-colon to work here , both to reduce the choppiness and to show the relationship between the two sentences . <p> " I walked into the shop ; everything was on sale , so I bought a lot . " <p> As you can see , both parts of this sentence could stand alone with a full-stop between them , and if you did that , youd use the capital letter . When you place a semi-colon between them , they become one sentence , so no capital letter is used . It also links the ideas . When you walked into the shop , you saw that everything was on sale . That 's the reason why you bought a lot . <p> An important hint is to try not to join longer sentences together . A semi-colon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longer sentences are hard to read and understand . If you are in college or university , you may be tempted to write long , complicated sentences . But if your work becomes difficult to read , it also becomes difficult to mark , and your professors have a lot of papers to go through . Keep your sentences short , purposeful and crisp . <p> Advice to neophytes : if you 're still not sure when to use a semi-colon , just avoid using them altogether . Keep your sentences punchy and only handle one thought at a time . <h> Colons <p> Colons are a little easier to use and understand . That 's because the first part of the sentence could stand alone . It is followed by a statement that either can or cant stand alone , but that expands on the idea in the first part of the sentence . Confused ? Hang in there ! here 's where you use colons : <p> When you make a list : I had to pack a lot of things : sunblock , a hat , my beach towel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach sandals . <p> When you quote someone : As Churchill said : " We will never surrender ! " <p> To link very , very closely related sentences : Troubles are like bubbles : they float away and die . <p> Using colons in the wrong places is a common fault , and as you can see , the only time you 'd use a capital letter after a colon is when you are quoting someone . Your speaker is starting a new sentence , so after the first inverted comma , you usually have a capital letter . What happens after inverted commas if you still want to continue the sentence , or what to do if you are quoting a fragment of a sentence is another matter , and well leave that for another day . <p> A common colon error can easily be avoided . The first part of your sentence the bit before the colon should be an independent clause . It should be able to stand on its own as a sentence . For example , if I were to use a colon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on safari , including : giraffes , lions , crocodiles , and many types of deer , " that would be wrong . <p> Read this : " I saw a lot of animals on safari including . " Is that first part a full sentence ? It certainly is n't . The moral of the story ? That 's not the right kind of place to put a colon . A colon would be fine if that sentence read : " I saw a lot of animals on safari : giraffes , lions , etc . " <p> Look at the first part of that sentence : " I saw a lot of animals on safari . " Its a perfect independent clause . It stands alone . <p> There you have it . The vast majority of the time you simply do n't  capitalize the word after a semi-colon or a colon . <p> For those wanting to improve vocabulary and spelling , doing so does n't  have to be all hard work and no play . Word games get our mental juices going as we strive to solve puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that magically make sense when arranged in the right way . <p> If you were to search this title on the internet , youd mostly find reference to word gaming apps , and many of them are really quite good , but on the whole , its still the classics that are the most fun . That 's not to say you should avoid the apps . Many are based on the classics , and the ones that set time limits for you to make your move or expect you to find as many words as possible in a given time provide an extra challenge and a shot of adrenalin . Still , its still worthwhile to play some of the classic games from time to time since they can be pure word joy . <h> Scrabble <p> This game will always be a classic choice and trying to hit those double or triple word scores adds an element of strategy . Before you begin , be sure to decide on a dictionary to use as your source . Scrabble specific dictionaries often allow a lot of words that are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I prefer to use my trusty dictionary set as a reference ; if its not there , you cant use it . Of course , that 's just me . Many people are happy to immerse themselves in scrabble dictionaries to learn sneaky new two and three letter words , or a variety of words that begin with the letter Q. <h> Crosswords <p> If you do n't  have a handy friend to compete against , a solitary word game works best . Crosswords range from the deeply cryptic to the relatively simple , but they 're always challenging . Be sure to use a pencil with an eraser on the back , because there are times when more than one word fits the clue . <h> Hangman <p> To play this game the traditional way with pen and paper , you need a real live opponent . There are several app versions , so you can also load it on your smartphone to keep yourself entertained on your commute or when waiting for appointments . There are a number of variations on the theme , but they all involve guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing of hanged man progressing further so you have a limited amount of guesses . <h> Pictionary <p> This game is best played when you have at least three other people joining in . Its fun , there 's often hilarity , and you get to practice your language skills and your drawing skills simultaneously . Its been around since 1985 , and its still going strong . <h> Spill and Spell <p> Spill out the letters and see how many words you can make with them . Because you multiply the number of letters used in your word to calculate your points , the longer your word is , the better . A 5 letter word would make you 25 points , but a 6 letter word scores 36 . <h> Word Search <p> Puzzle books , newspapers , and magazines often offer word search games . Once again , there are plenty of word search puzzles available online . Can you find all the hidden words ? Sometimes , it can be quite tricky ! On the whole , though , its an easy game that tests your powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target puzzles are among my favorites even though they often have me beaten after hours of thought . You really have to think out of the box , and finding all the words hidden in the 9 letters the puzzle offers is truly challenging . Youre given 9 letters , one of which has to be included in every word you make . There 's usually just one 9-letter word hidden in your letter set but there may be several 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 letter words . How many can you find ? <h> Typing Games <p> Typing games help you to improve your typing speed , accuracy , and spelling . There are tons of free options online , or you could just set a timer and try your hand at touch typing by copying a random text .

At the same time , you 'll learn some pretty obscure words while you try to distinguish fake definitions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Words with Friends <p> There has to be at least one high-tech word game in the bunch , and Words with Friends is a hugely popular option with many celebrities giving it the thumbs up . Basically , its scrabble played online , but I 've been warned that its highly addictive . As a natural-born words geek , I 've been avoiding it because I 'm sure all my writing will go down the drain if I begin to play . <p> Do you know another great word game you like to play ? Share it in the comments so we can add it to this list ! <p> What 's in a name ? Actually , quite a lot , especially if you 're blogging . You may have a dedicated group of followers wholl read everything you post no matter what title you give it , but if you want to attract new readers and hold their attention , tiles are vitally important . Not convinced ? Check out the 10 reasons why your blog title can make or break your blog post . <h> You have five seconds and maybe less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this list , pay attention to this . You have five seconds or less : that 's how long it takes for someone to decide whether they 're going to read your post or not . Without a compelling title , your blog post will fall flat . Your content could include wit , entertaining or useful information , but still get ignored completely . Spend time thinking about your title . Play around with a few alternatives . Its worth taking an extra few minutes to craft the right title for your post . its also important to capitalize your titles correctly no matter which style you choose . If you are n't  sure , use a headline capitalization tool to make sure you 're accurate and consistent . <h> Titles tell people what your article is about <p> This may seem like a no-brainer , but if you think about it , you 'll start remembering all the say-nothing titles you 've encountered . For example , A word to the wise says absolutely nothing about what your reader should expect to find in your article . You can write a fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets read . <h> Improve traffic from search engines <p> This is one of the most important considerations you need to take into account when crafting a title . Being keyword savvy will help search engines to direct potential readers to your post . What words are people using to search for the information you 're about to share ? Try your keywords out on AdWords keyword planner to see how often your terms are searched and what the competition is like . <h> Engage your readers <p> Think about your potential readership . What do they want ? Most people are looking for actionable information that applies to them . In most cases ( but not all ) they 're not interested in you or your opinions , but they do want to find something that they can use . <p> For example , this post could have been titled " Blog titles are important " . Its rather ho-hum boring , but that 's what the article is about . Instead , you have been brought into the equation . Titles are important to YOUR blog articles . You also know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten . That means that the writer cant just waffle . <p> The other extreme is an alienating title : " The philosophy of blog post title writing and the marked effect of titles on search engine statistics " sounds like its going to put you to sleep . It also sounds downright pompous ! <h> Get potential readers excited <p> Have you ever come across a title that made you feel as if you simply had to read the article that went with it ? And once youd read it , you could n't help sharing it with everyone you know . That 's the kind of excitement you 'd like your blog to generate and it all begins with the title . At the same time , you should n't resort to using cheap tactics . Your title still has to reflect the factual content of your post . If you lure readers in and then do n't  deliver the goods , they wont be back . " 10 sensational ways to fight fat " might sound exciting , but if your diet and exercise tips are n't  sensational , your reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post ? <p> Think about it . If you ca n't think of a reason for someone to want to read your post , you should probably choose another topic . You 'll see this principle in action in titles that pose a question or include questioning words like why and what . For example , " Why you should eat avocados to lose weight " or " What you need to know about income tax " are way better than " Avocados for weight loss " or " Income tax explained " . <h> Take advantage of peoples curiosity <p> Curiosity is a wonderful thing , and you can use it to your advantage . Do n't  distil your entire articles contents into the title and first paragraphs . Create a " read on " moment by stimulating curiosity and leading your reader to want more . <p> You 'll see this a lot in sales copy . Therell be a sensational headline " Get mega-conversions on your e-commerce site with this clever strategy " it trumpets . Then the writer builds suspense : " What if I told you that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " and so on , before delivering the coup de grace the actual strategy he or she is talking about . <h> Titles may be all the reader sees <p> Think about your own search habits . You enter the keyword and get gazillions of search results . You scan the titles for promising-looking content before you even bother with the meta-descriptions . If the title of an article or post does n't  interest you , your eyes just slide off it and you keep looking until you see a title that looks relevant and interesting . <h> Entertaining or thought-provoking <p> People are n't  only looking for information online they also want to be amused , entertained or interested . Use plays on words and humor cautiously though a sense of humor failure is a common phenomenon online ! <h> Curveballs and controversy <p> Taking a stance that 's outside mainstream of public opinion can generate a lot of interest and interaction , but once again , you do need to be cautious . If you 're going to be controversial , expect some flak and be prepared to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , you will have people reading your article which is better than nobody reading it at all . <p> You look at the page and see three words : weather , whether and wether . Although none of these three words is spelled the same , they all sound the same when you say them . They 're classed as homonyms . They have the same pronunciation but different meanings . Its easy to confuse them , and its easy to write one word when you really want to use another ( this is more common than you think in English such as with on to and onto , and it can happen even with words that are n't  homonyms like further and farther . How can you tell the difference ? <h> Wether : something you never knew about sheep <p> First , " wether " is hardly ever used , so you can almost forget about it , but its still good to know its meaning . Yes , some people might write it by accident instead of " whether " or even " weather " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wether is a male sheep or goat that 's had a particularly sensitive operation in the groin area we wont explain in detail here . Its only farmers and animal experts who usually need to know and use this word . <h> Weather : just look out the window <p> People everywhere love to complain about the weather no matter if its the rain , the wind , the sun , or a combination of all of these . Weather is the state of the natural environment in a place at a particular time . Cold weather comes with winter , and hot or warm weather arrives in summer . <p> Of course , the northern hemisphere has winter at the same time that the south has summer . This means that different seasons actually occur at the same time in different places , not just different weather . This is where weather becomes a little confusing , but you do n't  need to worry about this . Just understand what the word means . When it starts with " we , " its talking about the natural conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be or not to be <p> On the other hand , " whether " has absolutely nothing to do with sheep or how it is outside . This word is normally used as a conjunction . " And " is a conjunction . So is " or . " Consider this sentence : <p> " Whether we go to the moon or not , we will think its beautiful . " <p> Its almost the same as saying : <p> " If we go to the moon , or if we stay on Earth , we will think the moon is beautiful . " <p> So " whether " is very much like " if . " And you can see that you have two choices . One is fabulous : you can visit the moon . This means you 're either an astronaut or a billionaire with your own private space vehicle . If that 's so , you can stop reading this right now and do all the important things you have on your schedule today . The second choice is a lot duller : to stay home . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we have two happy endings . <p> A variation of this occurs in the following sentence : <p> " I do n't  know whether I can pass astronaut training school . " <p> There is just one situation stated here : to pass . You can either pass or fail , so you have two choices , but the " pass " option is the only one stated . In the first sentence , you can either go or not go , and that 's two choices as well , but both are clearly stated . <p> And if you want to pass astronaut school , we recommend a lot more advanced math and science in addition to English . You also need to be athletic , healthy , smart , dedicated , lucky But anythings possible . <h> Language keeps changing whether you like it or not <p> " Whether " also used to be a pronoun that meant the same as " which " or " whichever . " For example : <p> " Whichever you buy , the Rolls-Royce or the Cadillac , you 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy the Rolls-Royce or the Cadillac , you 'll have a great car . " <p> Now , these are not personal pronouns like " I " or " you . " There are quite a few types of pronouns , but they all have this in common : they replace nouns or refer to nouns . So in the sentence above , " whichever " refers to " Cadillac " and " Rolls-Royce . " Since " whether " is not really used as a pronoun these days , you do n't  need to remember this definition . Just think " if " any time you see " whether , " and you 'll be on the right track . <h> Whatever the weather you 'll know whether you 're right <p> Knowing what the weather will do next is n't easy , but knowing whether you should use one homonym or another is just a little memory game . As for the sheep , most people would n't know what you were talking about anyway , so just call them sheep and you 'll be doing just fine . <p> If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can take like improving your vocabulary . It also helps to have a good grasp of grammar , and what may initially seem to be simple is n't always so . For example , can you guess how many pronouns are in the following sentence ? <p> " I bought all of these myself , so these are mine ; they are my things ! " <p> If you were able to find seven pronouns , then you found them all . If you found less than seven , you can check the answer by looking at the words below in bold . <p> I bought all of these myself , so these are mine ; they are my things ! <p> Yes , each word in bold is a pronoun . Remember , a pronouns relates to a noun , and that 's why the word " noun " is inside " pronoun . " When you do n't  want to or cant use a noun , you choose a pronoun . <h> Different Types of Pronouns <p> Since English is a complex language , there are different classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I " is the most common example of this . Then there are " we , you , he/she , it , they . " They refer to humans , or living beings such as animals , so they are personal . I the simplest terms , they deal with persons . <p> " Myself " can be either an intensive pronoun or a reflexive pronoun . In the sentence above , its intensive because the speaker wants to emphasize that he alone bought the items . And since " myself " actually refers to " I , " not a proper noun , you can see that pronouns sometimes refer to other pronouns . In the sentence below , " myself " is reflexive : <p> " I gave myself a good lecture because I was disappointed in my work . " <p> The person doing the action and the one receiving the action are the same , so its a reflexive act and a reflexive pronoun . All pronouns that end with " self " or " selves " must be either reflexive or intensive , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions or feelings that happen between two people . For example : <p> They gave each other Christmas presents . <p> They like one another so much that they are never apart . <p> The two most common ones are , naturally , " each other " and " one another . " <p> Possessive pronouns are easy to understand . They show who owns or who has something . " My , your , his , her , its , our , their " are possessive . Would you say : " This is Mandy , David , Sue and Lisas house ? " No . You would say , " This is their house . " In this way , possessive pronouns are useful and convenient . Absolute possessive pronouns are similar : " mine , yours , his , hers , ours , theirs . " The difference between the two types is that you can not use a possessive alone , but you can use absolute possessive alone . <p> 1 . The telescope is my property . 2 . The telescope is mine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my . " The second sentence shows that " mine " does n't  need one . <p> You use a relative pronoun when you want to introduce more information or another idea . <p> " The park , which is far from the city , has a zoo with African animals . " <p> When you ask a question , the first word is often an interrogative pronoun . <p> Which horse runs the fastest ? <p> How do you wash the dishes so well ? <p> As you can see , " which " is either relative or interrogative . How you use a pronoun can determine what type it is . <p> Another issue that makes pronouns a little more complicated is a word like " how . " It does n't  refer to any noun . It is used to ask about a way or method or cause . <p> When you read or hear " this , that , these , those , " you have an example of demonstrative pronouns . They show people exactly what is being talked about . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner is worthless . " <p> Finally , we have indefinite pronouns . They are n't  like the other types because they do n't  refer to any specific person or object . " All , some , any , none , no one " are examples of this . When you use these pronouns , you are speaking or writing in a general way . These words can refer to many possible people <p> All the people of the world want peace . <p> Some of them love to laugh , but others are very serious . <p> As you can see , answering the question , " What is a pronoun ? " is a lot more complicated than it first appears . This article should have given you a good basic understanding of what a pronoun is , and the different types of pronouns which exist in the English language . <p> When it comes to the question of directions , there 's often quite a bit of confusion as to whether or not you should capitalize the directions north , south , east and west . Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  , and sometimes the difference between the two is n't readily apparent . In other words , the answer is " it depends . " For those who are looking for a general rule of thumb , the answer to the question , " When do you capitalize directions ? " the answer is You capitalize north , east , south and west when they 're part of a proper name , but you do n't  if they only indicate direction . <p> Chances are that one of the reasons you 're here is that you 've noticed that you sometimes see directions capitalized , while at other times you do n't  . The question is , how do you know when you should be using the capital letter ? <h> Directions : north , south , east and west <p> When you 're using a direction to describe nothing but the direction , lower case letters are the ones to choose . For example , if you say " The sun is weakest on the north side ( or northern side ) " lower case letters are fine . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show orientation of the sun , and you 're not using the direction as a proper name . On a side note , the directions in the title of this article are capitalized due to headline capitalization rules even though they merely indicate direction . <p> As soon as you start using directions as part of a proper name , they get capitalized . Its similar to why your name is always capitalized . So , if a person is from South Africa , south would be capitalized since its the proper name of the country . When you 're talking about Americas West Coast or the Middle East , the directional word is also part of a proper name , and it gets a capital letter . Sometimes , people abbreviate these names which can make it a bit more confusing . For example , you could say a person is from the West or the East meaning they are from the West Coast or the East Coast in the US . Even though you do n't  spell it out completely , you still use a capital letter . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to understand , talking about a region , such as Western Europe , means capitals are used . On the other hand , if you tell someone to go south along the freeway , that 's just a direction , and it gets a lowercase letter . This may seem pretty straightforward , but there are times when there is a debate as to whether or not the direction is just a direction , or if its a proper name . <p> Not everyone agrees on whether you should capitalize the direction in a sentence like , " As a Southerner , he had a distinctive drawl . " Some say that you 're talking about someone who is from a particular region , and that a capital letter should be used . Others argue its just a direction of the place the person lives and does n't  get a capital letter . I 'm inclined to think that the regional opinion is spot on , but this is an example of how differing opinions can lead to one person using a capital letter while another would use a lowercase letter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your second language , idioms may well puzzle you . The words that are used have little or nothing to do with the topic under discussion , but English speakers slip them in without thinking twice ( if you 're interested in learning the meaning of many common idioms , you can use this random phrase generator ) . If you are a native English speaker and you 're wondering how on earth these figures of speech came to be a part of the English language , in many instances you 'll have your work cut out tracking their origins . Sometimes they 're well known , and sometimes , they 're quite obscure . <p> You may have noticed I used the phrase have your work cut out . Its a typical example of an idiom . For those looking for a definition , an idiom is a frequently used saying where the words of the saying do n't  relate to their literal meaning . To illustrate , what has cutting out got to do with having a difficult task to perform ? The answer is simply " We do n't  know " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped into common parlance , but nobody is absolutely sure . <h> Mad hatters , cats and dogs and more <p> Although idioms are a bit crazy after all , the individual words do n't  make literal sense , they do make the language more fun and colorful . For example , you could say that its raining very hard , but that is n't nearly as colorful as saying its raining cats and dogs , even though canines and felines are not falling from the sky . The origins of this particular idiom are also foggy , but that does n't  stop us from using the phrase . <p> English is an eccentric language , and its students might even think were all as mad as hatters . Lovers of literature may be pardoned for thinking that the idiomatic phrase " mad as a hatter " comes from the classic childrens story " Alice in Wonderland " , but theyll have to look for darker origins to get to the truth of the matter . Old-fashioned hat makers worked with mercurous nitrate , and mental disturbance was a symptom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean and where they come from <p> You can purchase whole dictionaries of idioms , so covering them all with a blog post would be absolutely impossible , but we 've tracked down some common ones and did our best to uncover their origins . <p> " Driving me up the wall / round the twist " means that something is , at least figuratively speaking , maddening . A constant noise , someone elses irritating habit or trying to grasp a difficult concept are all things that might drive you up the wall . No-one really knows when this idiom slipped into English , but the words themselves create the image of someone desperately trying to get away . <p> " Once in a blue moon " , " Over the moon " and " Asking for the moon " are among the many moon related expressions we use . A happy person who has just had something wonderful happen to them is " Over the moon " with this turn of events . A demanding person who wants you to do the impossible is " Asking for the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blue moon " . So-called blue moons occur when there are two full moons in one month . Its a rare occurrence , hence its use as an idiom . <p> " A case of the pot calling the kettle black " is a very old idiom and was first recorded by Cervantes in his classic book " Don Quixote " . It is used to describe someone who accuses another person of being something that they are themselves . Of course , back then , all cooking was done over the fire , so you can be sure that both pots and kettles were equally black . <p> " Beat around the bush " means avoiding the main point or issue . Its one of the oldest idioms in English , and the oldest example we know of that comes from a medieval poem . Hunters would send beaters out to beat at bushes so that birds or game would emerge , and then the hunt would be on . Obviously , the beaters did n't  get any game themselves , hence the saying . The 1440 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full long agoo , Some bete the bussh and some the byrdes take . " <p> " Bad books " and " Black Books " are idioms for being displeased with someone . On the other side of the coin , there are " Good books " . This idiom demonstrates how the English language has changed . The word " books " was used in the same way as we use the word " esteem " today . There was n't actually a book about how you felt about others , so back in the Middle Ages , these sayings werent even idioms they were a literal form of speech . " Passing the buck " , a disapproving way of saying that someone is handing on responsibilities to others , has its origins in the Wild West . Poker players took their game seriously , and to keep it as fair as possible , each player would have an opportunity to deal the cards . To show who would be dealer next , a knife , usually with a buck horn handle , would be placed on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sometimes idioms come from folk wisdom . " Crying over spilt milk " would be a good example of this . Sometimes they come from stories and literature , and sometimes they have their origins in the obsolete uses of words . Studying them is more interesting than you might expect , so getting an idiom dictionary can be a worthwhile investment , even if you already know the meanings of many of them . <p> Becoming a lawyer means you have to become good at a very specialized type of writing . In law , its not so much a matter of how much you write as how you write it . But as the saying goes : " Practice makes perfect , " and with business deals , agreements and even peoples futures on the line , if you miss an important point or choose the wrong words , the ramifications can be huge . <p> here 's the main point you need to understand about writing and law school . You probably wont be writing anything extraordinarily lengthy while at law school , but writing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a single paragraph , tweaking it to make it just right . For the layman , legal writing might just look like a lot of words strung together , but every one of them is there for a reason and getting them right is crucial . <h> Your law review papers will be the longest <p> Most law students agree that the volume of writing is n't so much of an issue . Your longest pieces will be law review papers , and the footnotes alone can be extensive and time-consuming . But they warn course work grades are often based on essays or papers , and the marks you get on these will make or break your pursuit of a law degree . <p> In the first year , chances are you 'll have to do a course covering legal research and writing . As you may have guessed , it will involve quite a lot of writing . But thereafter , the volume of written work decreases . The most important thing will be being able to write well and cram a lot of information into a few clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the volume is n't all that huge , but if you want to do well , you will probably need to practice not only your writing but your reading . <h> Practice reading ? <p> At law school , you need to learn how to write like a lawyer , and there 's no better way of doing that than to learn to read like a lawyer . That means being able to grasp the language that is used and believe me although its English , its not the kind of English you 'd usually use when you hang out with your buddies . <p> According to many law professors , reading like a lawyer is the biggest hurdle for most students . You may need hours to read a case that 's only a few pages when you first become a student . The good news is that the more you read , the better you get at understanding all the legal language , and the better equipped you 'll be when the time comes to do your own writing . <h> Its a learned skill and you will use it a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're planning to download makes your eyes go blurry , and wading through contracts before you sign them gives you a headache , you 're not alone . Legal writing is a learned skill and uses its own special language and terminology . If you have a genuine eagerness to become a lawyer , you will need to master it . <p> You shouldnt be considering a legal career if you do n't  like writing . Legal writing is a bit like " blood and guts " and becoming a doctor . You might not see them all the time as a student , but when you do , things are n't  going to work out for you if you 're squeamish . Lawyers deal with words . There 's no such thing as a lawyer who does n't  write . <h> Do you want to be a lawyer but not sure you 'll cope ? <p> For a start , be absolutely sure you know what being a lawyer is like . A lot of students do n't  . Its nothing like what you see on TV . The reality of working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ( and nothing but the truth ) is that many lawyers will seldom see the inside of a courtroom . If you do end up in court , most of it will be very un-dramatic and quite boring . <p> Before you apply for law school read up on what being a lawyer would entail and how your career would progress . If law still sounds like just the thing for you , you can get a head start on your fellow students by reading " Thinking Like a Lawyer : A New Introduction to Legal Reasoning " by Frederick Schauer . Hint : It will likely cover a lot of the work you 'll be given in your first year . <p> If you can grasp that legal reasoning , you 'll likely be able to manage the writing as well . Writing starts with thinking , and once you think like a lawyer , you should have the skills to write like one and get through law school . 
@@12747245 @1347245/ <h> Tag : 200 words <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences in a paragraph , there 's no single answer to this question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general , you 'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea , and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you 'd expect . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your readers attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> " White Space " is a great way to make your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the answer is " It depends " Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a blog post , and I want to keep the reader engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses 37 words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers , for example : <p> " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " Cool ! " <p> As you can see , I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves . Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long . <h> Academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips , 2014 ) with references . Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon see why this should be the case ( Me , 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many words per paragraph ? Its really up to you ! <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . <p> Making them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader . A lot of text without " white space " is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to digest . So , whatever you do , do n't  forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to baffle the reader . <p> By the way , the above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't always better ? I 'm ready to bet that you do . 
@@12747246 @1347246/ <p> If you listen to a National Basketball Association ( NBA ) game on television or the radio , there 's a good chance that at some point during the telecast , you 'll hear the announcers say that a player is " dropping a dime " or some similar variation of that sentence . You can sometimes see the reference in commercials with basketball players as well . For those who are n't  familiar with its meaning , it sounds strange and out of place and the chances are you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about . <h> What is a " dime " referring to in basketball ? <p> A " dime " in basketball is the same thing as an assist . For those unfamiliar , a basketball assist occurs when one player makes a pass to a teammate which leads that teammate to score a basket . By making the pass to the teammate , the player has " assisted " in the making of the basket . <p> Usually , an assist is recorded when a pass is made to the teammate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball , but this is n't a hard-set rule . While this is the case most of the time , there is some judgement involved when considering whether an assist has been made or not . For example , a player who passes to a teammate who is breaking toward the basket and that teammate dribbles once while continuing the cut toward the basket would be given an assist even though the player dribbled . <p> Assists are an important statistic kept for basketball players during each game . Assists are one of the big four statistics ( assists , points scored , steals and blocks ) tallied each game . They 're also recorded on a career level as well as career assists . The statistic is important and valued in basketball because setting up teammates with good passes can lead to easier baskets than for the player to try to score all on their own . <h> Why is an assist called a dime ? <p> The origin of a basketball assist being called a dime is n't readily known . There are a variety of theories , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when pay phones were available across the US . When payphones were most popular ( long before cell phones were the norm ) it cost a dime to make a phone call . If one needed to make a phone call , it was common for that person to ask , " does anyone have a dime ? " In this sense , " dropping a dime " or giving someone a dime was assisting someone to make a phone call . Most people believe this phrase ended up transferring over to the NBA as helping a teammate make a basket . <p> Although " dropping a dime " is considered a positive move for basketball , it does n't  always have positive connotations when used in other circumstances . For example , " dropping a dime " is a way to label a person a snitch or someone who tells on another person . Again , the reference to making a phone call is used as when someone tells ( calls ) authorities to inform someone has broken the law , thus snitching on them . <p> Another popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on a dime , " " turning on a dime , " " at a drop of a dime , " and " stopping on a dime . " These phrases all refer to precision , doing it quickly and without hesitation all characteristics of most assists in basketball . A quick pass right on the mark to a teammate will assist that teammate in scoring . <h> 12 comments <p> This is one of those terms that has never made sense to me . Why do n't  they just call it an assist since that 's its proper name ? All this " dropping dimes " crap seems to be done to make the people saying it feel special like they know a secret code that others do n't  . If it was something that people could figure out on their own , that 's one thing , but how is anyone supposed to figure out dime = assist ? <p> I think this helps clear it up because many people have no idea what it is . It would be easier to use the term assist but then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different names . If you want to be a basketball fan , you have to be willing to learn the lingo that goes with it . <p> I think most people who do n't  watch basketball regularly get confused by this term . On the surface of it , it does n't  make sense to call an assist " a dime . " I think I 've had to explain the meaning to at least a dozen friends who have watched basketball games with me over the years . <p> Shouldnt they all it a " quarter " instead of a dime ? Payphones cost quarter for a longer time than they cost a dime . Nobody can even remember when payphones cost a dime . They should be calling assists quarters . That makes a whole lot more sense . <p> By this logic , they should be dropping 50 cents of dollars since that is what it costs to make a call from a payphone now ( if you can even find one ) . When payphone were originally created , it cost a dime to make a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still used today for an assist in basketball . <p> I always wondered about this . It seems so strange to talk about dimes when talking about basketball . I guess it makes sense , but its a pretty old-school way to refer to it . I can see why people get confused . <p> I believe dime means to give . I think this term came up in the 70s .. where the coin was made I guess . On its own I know , it does n't  make much sense . Foodstamps and Jimmy Carters dropping Dimes perhaps ? Rough guess .. <p> For the nonbasketball fans who only watch occasionally , this is a great post to explains why the announcers are always saying " dimes " . Its helpful as you hear the word a lot in games , but have no idea what it actually is . The NBA is n't all super fans . A lot of casual fans want to know what these words mean . <p> There 's the commercial that talks about " dropping dimes " that 's for an insurance company or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that I came searching for what it meant . I do n't  think most people who are n't  basketball fans would know what this means without some type of explanation . 
@@12747247 @1347247/ <h> " Onto " vs " On To " The Difference Between the Two <p> There are a number of words which can be confusing to those using English . Some examples include was vs were , who vs whom , and further vs farther . Another of those is onto and on to . They look so similar , and yet they are so different . When you 're talking , nobodys going to be looking for a space between on and to , but when you 're writing , that little space can make the difference between correct work and an embarrassing mistake . <p> There 's actually quite a big difference between on to and onto , but there 's also a really simple way to know which one of these options you should be using at any given time . Well first look at the reasons , and then well check out the cheat that will solve your dilemma without too much grammatical analysis . The big difference explained <h> When to use onto <p> Onto could , in many instances , be replaced with the less commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed on top of or ended up on something else . Although you might be pardoned for thinking it to be an adverb , its actually a preposition . For example : <p> The frog jumped onto the stone . <p> My cat crept onto my lap . <p> I do n't  know how the mayonnaise got onto my sweater . <p> In informal language , onto is also used to show that you 're on top of a situation , or well-informed : <p> I 'm onto your sneaky plan ! <p> Ill be onto the next task as soon as this one is done . <h> When to use on to <p> In this instance on is part of a phrase containing a verb and acts as an adverb , while to is a preposition linked to an object . For example : <p> She held on to the steering wheel . <p> I will log on to your website . <p> We had to move on to the next exhibit . <p> On is associated with the verbs held , log and move in these examples , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel , the website or the exhibit . <h> An easy cheat <p> To save yourself from the tricky business of sentence analysis every time you have to decide whether or not you 'll use on to or onto , try this cheat . In most cases , it will clarify which of the two you should use . <p> Try taking the word up and see how it fits into the sentence if you use it before on . If its a good fit , onto is likely to be the correct word choice . So , using the first of each of our sets of examples : <p> The frog jumped ( up ) onto the stone . <p> She held ( up ) on to the starring wheel . <p> As we can see , up fits well into the first example , but does n't  make any sense in the second . This cheat works nine times out of ten , but there may still be times when choosing between on and onto can be confusing . For instance : <p> We wandered on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These sentences are both correct , but they have slightly different meanings . In the first example , the speaker and his companions wandered from one place to another . They did n't  necessarily end up on the football field itself , but they chose to approach it . They moved on from one place to another . <p> In the second example , the group of people ended up on the football field itself . This could be compared with the frog jumping ( up ) onto a stone . So when all else fails , analysing the meaning you are trying to convey may help you with your dilemma . <h> In conclusion <p> As insignificant as the difference between onto and on to may seem , there are specific instances in which one or the other will be the correct choice . Working out which of the two is correct can be achieved by analysing the sentence , by checking on meaning , or by trying the word up before on as a cheat . If the sentence still makes sense with up inserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who use English as a second language , and understanding the difference between words that looked very similar can be difficult for us . Just because its easy for you does n't  mean that its easy for other people . Maybe you should think about other people and why they might want to know the difference rather than being limited to your own experiences . There are a lot of people who did n't  go to elementary school in the US that find this information useful . <p> Even though it might sound like a silly post I think it is great . There are so many people who still do not know how to use these 2 words and get them mixed up . It is actually quite sad to say the least , but this might help some people better understand the difference between the two words . <p> LonelyNights : Some of us have extreme disadvantages , I 'll share mine so maybe you 'll understand .

@@12747248 @1347248/ <h> Month : October 2015 <p> Weve added some new tools to Word Counter which were hoping will be beneficial to all those using our word count tool . One of these new features is the countdown goal counter . This feature allows writers to set a word ( character , sentence or paragraph ) count goal they need to reach or must stay under in their writing . <p> This feature is simple to use . Click on the " Goal " button directly above where you place text into Word Counter . Once done , a small " Set Goal " screen will appear which will say , " Enter the number of characters , words , sentences or paragraphs you want to set a goal . " In the first space , you place the goal number to write , then choose words , characters , sentences or paragraphs . You must also choose whether this amount is a minimum ( you want to write at least this many words ) or a maximum ( you do n't  want to write over this many words ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , press the " Set " button and you 'll be back to the main page , but just to the right of the Goal button will be a counter with the goal you just set . As words ( characters , sentences or paragraphs ) are added in the writing space , the goal counter will display the number of words ( characters , sentences or paragraphs ) still needed to be written to hit the goal . Once your goal is reached when you set a minimum amount , the counter will turn green to let you know you 've succeeded . If you set a limit with a maximum amount , the counter will turn red to let you know if you exceed the number . <p> This feature can prove to be quite useful for a number of different writers . For example , students who have a writing assignment with a minimum number of words can plug that number into the goal setter so they will know when they have written enough for the assignment . It can also be used to make sure you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need to write a college application essay of no more than 1,000 words . Its also a great feature for those who are trying to write a certain number of words on a daily basis . Using the goal setter will allow the writer to know where she stands in relation to her daily goal . <p> For some writers , it can also be seen as an excellent motivational tool . Those who are aiming to write more can use the tool to set a specific goal , and then they can watch as they get closer and closer to their set goal . Watching this number decrease as they write can be encouraging , and help encourage writers meet a daily minimum word count . <p> One of the hardest things about writing fiction is creating characters that are believable . Too many writers create characters that are just like themselves . While this seems like a way of " writing what you know , " too often it ends up creating a " Mary Sue " character . Mary Sues come across as poorly developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters in their own right . <p> So how to create a character that is believable if the character is nothing like you and shares nothing of your experience ? How do you create , for example , an accountant with five kids if you flunked basic math and hate kids ? If you want to create good writing , the keys are research , observation , and personal experience . There are several ways to go about gathering the information needed to create a well-rounded , believable character . Here are some ideas . <h> Library , archive , and online research <p> If you 're trying to learn about an unfamiliar occupation , historical period ( including mannerisms , clothing , occupations , etc. ) , medical condition , or location , simple research is the best place to start . And do n't  just settle for a quick Google search . Spend some time looking at relevant documents/exhibits and immersing yourself in the information . Your character would be living this life , so do n't  treat it lightly . <h> Shadow someone else <p> If you 're trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives that life and shadow them . Writing about an investment banker ? See if you can find one who will let you follow them for a day . Writing about a single mother who goes to night school ? See if someone you know fits that description and will let you ride along for a day or two . <h> Work their job <p> See if you can do the actual work that your characters will be doing . Some jobs may be closed to you , but you may have some success getting close enough if you offer to volunteer . If your character is a rancher , ask if you can volunteer on a dude ranch for a few days . Or see if you can volunteer in a classroom to get closer to being a teacher . Volunteering in a hospital may get you close enough to the medical profession that you can create a believable doctor , even if you ca n't be one yourself . <h> Interviews <p> Let 's say you need to understand how a serial killer works . Chances are , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , but probably not . And youd better not become one . ) What can you do ? Interview people who work with/around serial killers . See if you can speak to a psychiatrist , cop , or coroner to get an idea of the motivations , methods , etc. of a serial killer . Its always best if you can interview someone directly about their job or life but if you cant , think of a way around that limitation . Speak to people who work with or around the subject you need to know about . <h> Visit their location <p> If your characters are living in an unfamiliar location , try to visit that location . You 'll get a better sense of the place , people , and opportunities/lifestyles if you go there rather than just relying on travel guides . Location visits are also useful for battlefields and historical settings , as well . <h> People watch <p> Watching people is one of the best ways to learn about them . Figure out where your character would go ( for work , leisure , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time watching how to the people act , interact , and speak . What do they do ? Where do they go ? What do they talk about ? What are they wearing ? <h> Create a character profile <p> Spend some time filling in all the details you can about this person , even if those details wont make it into the book . Appearance , age , medical history , traits , quirks , politics , religion , background , genealogy , education , relationships , life experiences , career , childhood experiences , residences , travels , and more are all things you should know . The more you know about your character , the more lifelike she will seem and the better able you 'll be to determine how shed deal with the situations in your story . If you really want your character to come to life , consider giving him or her 10 traits that you never plan to reveal directly to the reader . These will come through in your writing even though you do n't  directly share the details with the reader giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want <p> Characters , just like real people , are driven by a variety of needs and forces . Youll have to figure out what they want to gain from the story as a whole ( win the war , secure the romantic relationship , kill the bad guy , etc. ) as well as what they hope to achieve at each decision and action point within the larger story . Even something as mundane as , " Why is the character speaking to the landlord ? " has a motivation behind it ( or it should ) . Is she hoping to get a lower rent , or is she seeking information on property management ? Does the landlord have a clue that your character needs to solve a mystery ? Is she looking for a date ? The motivations matter and can greatly change how a character acts in any given scene . Know their motivations and write accordingly . <h> Pay attention to speech <p> Your characters need to speak like real people , only without all the " ums " and " likes " that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak in a dialect , or with an accent . They might have a peculiar speech pattern due to mental illness or a tic . They may speak like a well-educated person or a poorly educated one . There will be gender differences , as well . Good dialogue that matches the characters is hard to pull off ( go easy on the slang and dialect to avoid annoying the reader , but make it apparent that its there ) but its essential . Otherwise , all your characters sound the same and that 's boring ( not to mention difficult on the reader ) . Observe people who speak like your characters and try to capture that on the page . <h> Do n't  deviate from their nature <p> If you 've spent the entire book creating a needy , shy , retiring character , you can not suddenly have that character fearlessly charge into battle and start slaying bad guys . You have to be true to the character . Doing otherwise feels forced and will turn readers off . If your character is going to change , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafting that change so that when it finally happens , it feels believable . <p> Creating a believable character is n't easy . You cant skimp on the details and hope that people just buy into your character . You have to give readers reasons to care and believe and that can only come through careful thought , research , and observation . Just slapping a person on the page and hoping for the best will have your readers reaching for the next story . Do n't  cop out and write a fictional version of yourself . Readers can tell when you 've done this . Give your characters their own unique personalities , failings , and successes and readers will be more willing to read the story you 're telling . <p> I 'm lucky in that I can write just about anywhere . I travel a lot which means I spend a lot of time in different places with different surroundings , and in most cases , I can make it work if I need to get something written . Even though I can write in most conditions , I have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a specific surrounding that 's most conducive for my writing productivity . That 's what I try to create as my writing space at home . Having a quality writing space can help immensely when you 're trying to write 1000 words a day . <p> If you have read anything on productivity , and especially writing productivity , one of the suggestions often given is to find a quiet place in the time you set aside to write . This is essentially a good point , but what " quiet " means will depend a lot on your own personal preferences . What you really want to do is find a space which allows you to write at an optimal level , and the chances are you are going to need to experiment a good amount to find what this exactly means for you . <p> It would be great to make a list of the perfect writing space , but the truth is what works for one writer may not work for the next . For example , I write much better while have the background noise of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having that distraction while trying to write . In the end , you will have to create your space for you , and that space will likely be different from other writers you know . That being said , I can list some of the choices I made when creating my space which you can use to consider what would be the best writing space for your needs . These are a few of the things I determined I needed for my space : <p> A restricted area where people cant regularly interrupt <p> No TV ( I learned early that if there was a TV in the room , it would eventually get turned on and my writing would end ) <p> Non-commercial music ( I write better with background noise , but only with music . I cant listen to radio where DJs speak as that ruins my writing rhythm ) <p> No phones ( and cell phones turned off ) <p> A good chair ( this is something I did n't  realize how important it was until I purchased a good chair ) <p> A notepad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible articles when I write ) <p> A timer ( I set my writing for 20 minutes and then take a break ) <p> A drink , but no food ( A large glass of iced tea is essential , but any food is a distrction <p> Those above are some of the things I have found make me more productive when I write . They may or may not be important for your writing productivity . There also may very well be other things that are important for you as a writer which I did n't  even mention . The important step to take is to begin to think about what is important for you to be in a space which is the most conducive for you to write at your optimal level , and begin creating it . ( 550 words ) <p> If you want to improve your writing productivity , you need to make writing a priority . While this may seem obvious , it actually took me a long time to learn , and I know other writers who struggle to do this as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write more are two completely different things . It took a long time for this to click for me , and I 'm sure there are others out there who struggle with it without even realizing they have n't noticed the difference . If you find you have all the best intentions to write 1000 words a day , but you are n't  able to reach that goal more days than you 're able to , there 's a good chance you are n't  making your writing a priority . <p> Making your writing a priority will mean you 're going to have to make some changes to your schedule . It may mean you will have to delay , or even give up , some of the things you enjoy doing . You 're going to have to make a concerted effort to put aside time to make sure you have the opportunity to reach your daily take a walk and begin writing . This is one example of a change I needed to make to my daily routine to truly make writing a priority . Some others included watching less Netflix , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent on several of my favorite hobbies . <p> here 's a challenge . Take a look at the things you are actually doing each day . The things you 're actually doing are what you are prioritizing over the things you are n't  able to find the time do . If the things you 're actually doing are n't  consistent with what you say you want to be doing , then either one of two things is going on : <p> 1 . What you say you want to do is n't really a priority <p> 2 . You need to change your life so that you 're actually doing what is a priority . <p> For most people , you 're going to have to make changes so writing becomes a priority ( if it was already a priority , youd already have no problem reaching your daily word count goal ) . This is especially true if your goal is to write more on a daily basis . Its often not easy to find the extra time to write as much as you want , but if writing 1000 words a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something you truly want to do , you 'll find a way to make that time . <p> On a side note , this really applies to all areas of your life , not just writing . Its good to do a monthly audit of how you spend your time to make sure you 're spending it doing the activities that are most important to you . If you find you are n't  spending time in a way that aligns with your goals , you need to figure out a way to change up your routine so those things most important to you become a priority . ( 659 words ) <p> Anyone who wants to be successful at writing 1000 words a day for an extended period of time will have to put aside time each time to reach that goal . The question becomes , when is the best time to set aside writing time each day ? While many will say to set the time aside when you enjoy writing most , Ive come to the conclusion that 's not necessarily the best approach when you are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I take a walk each morning which is an important aspect enabling me to be a productive writer . Upon my return each morning , I sit down to do a minimum of an hour , and as much as 3 hours of writing . The actual amount of time I have each day to write depends on what other things I have to do , but I make sure I have that minimum of an hour to write each morning . Since I have already outlined what I want to write in my head during the morning walk , I usually can hit my 1000 words during that hour . <p> I think its important to set aside time in the morning to write even if you do n't  happen to be a morning writer . I feel I can make this claim because I 'm definitely not naturally a morning writer . I used to do all my writing late at night , and I still do a good amount of my writing during the evening hours . What I 've discovered over time , however , is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fail to reach my writing goal much more often than if I set aside time in the morning . <p> There is a simple reason its important to put aside time in the morning if you want to be successful writing a certain number of words on an ongoing basis . Life happens . There will always be unexpected events which will make it impossible for you to write during your designated time no matter how faithfully you plan . This is especially true when you first begin a project like this and have n't yet established it as a routine . It takes time to carve out a specific period of time each day that 's devoted solely to writing , and one should expect hiccups while in the process of establishing this time ( and even afterward , although not as often ) . <p> When something happens and I 'm not able to write during my planned time in the morning , I immediately realize I missed the time I was supposed to writing . I instantly begin to figure out when I can make up that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 word goal . I have the rest of the day to make up for the unforeseen event and still reach my goal . <p> When I was writing in the evenings , if something unexpected happened , it was much more difficult to make up for life impeding on my writing . There just is n't enough extra time in the day to reschedule for missed time when its already in the evening , and the day is almost over . Due to the time factor , scheduling your daily writing period in the morning will give you a much better chance to reach your word count goal when you take up a challenge . <p> Another huge factor that came into play for me is energy level . The amount of energy I have at the end of the day depends on a lot of factors which happen during the day that are n't  always in my control . The result was that even when I had the time set aside , I was more likely to be tired . Many times I did n't  have the energy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was writing , the quality was n't necessarily the best . <p> If you 're not a person who usually writes in the morning , this change will be difficult . I know because of how difficult it was for me to adjust . Even today , I do n't  feel as comfortable writing in the morning as I do at night , but Ive gotten a lot better at it over time . More importantly , I have seen how much more productive I have become by beginning my writing early in the day rather than toward the end . <p> For anyone who has the goal of writing 1000 ( or more ) words a day , its worthwhile taking the time to figure out how to set aside time in the morning . That does n't  mean you cant write in the evenings as well . I still do on a regular basis , and as I 've stated above , I actually enjoy writing in the evening more than I do in the morning . Creating morning writing time will greatly increase your chances of hitting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important activities I do to increase my writing productivity which does n't  initially appear to have anything to do with writing is to take a morning walk . Before I turn on the computer , sit down to write , or do any other writing activity , I go outside to walk . While it may not first appear a walk would be something to increase my writing productivity , that 's exactly what it does . In fact , I can confidently say my morning walk is the most important step I take each day when it comes to being a productive writer . <p> There are a number of reasons my morning walk helps improve my writing productivity . Here are a few of them : <h> Arrange My Thoughts <p> This is the biggie . My morning walk allows me to go over the topic I 'm writing about so I can arrange my thoughts and what I want to write . Instead of sitting in front of the computer trying to figure out what I want to write , I 've already done this . In a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get down on paper . By sorting through all these thoughts , it allows me to begin writing as soon as I sit down in front of the computer . <h> More Productivity <p> Since I already have created the mental first draft , I already know exactly what I want to write when I sit at the computer . There is no staring at the computer screen wondering what I should write next . When I am writing , there 's a lot less stopping , rewriting and changing my mind . The walk allows me to have already mentally sorted through the common stopping points so all I have to do is get the words into the computer . <h> Brainstorm <p> Taking a morning walk does n't  only allow me time to think about my current writing , but also plan articles I can write in the future . Walking allows me to brainstorm about a variety of other topics . The result is I rarely sit in front of my computer wondering what topic I should write about next because I have a long list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writers Block <p> Walking prevents me from having writers block . In fact , I began walking when I was having writers block a few years ago . It worked so well at helping me overcome it , I started to make it a part of my daily routine . That 's how I discovered it made me so much more productive . If I ever reach a point where I 'm having trouble putting something down on paper , 99% of the time a short walk will help me overcome the obstacle . <h> Gives Me Energy <p> Exercise is a great way to increase energy . One of the greatest benefits from my morning walk is I feel a lot more energized . Due to this , I am able to write a lot more ( and for a longer period of time ) than I do when I try to write after I first wake up . My body is more alert and I feel ready to tackle the writing in front of me . <p> While taking a walk is what helps me write more productively , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do before you sit down in front of your computer . I have a writer friend who likes to sit quietly meditating under a large oak tree in her backyard . I have another writer friend who gets her quiet time in her garden . You know yourself better than anyone , so you need to understand what works best for you so you can find the quiet time that 's most appropriate for you . It should be something that even while you 're doing it , you have the opportunity to think and consider your writing at the same time . If it allows you to do that , anything is game . ( 653 words ) <p> For all those who are planning to participate in the National Novel Writing Month challenge in November , you may want to try a warm-up word count challenge with me in October . For anyone who is n't , but who wants to increase the amount of writing they 're producing , there 's no better time to begin than at this moment . Over the next month , I will document my 1000 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great goal for any writer who wants to begin getting into the habit of writing on a daily basis . As part of the challenge , I will explain some of the methods Ive developed over the years , and I hope others who are also doing this challenge ( or who have done a similar challenge in the past ) , will contribute their insights and tips to the conservation as well . <p> As I explained in a previous article , there are a number of steps anyone who decides to take up a challenge like this should consider and answer to better define the challenge . Doing so will make it more likely the challenge is completed . Here are my answers to each step : <p> Step one : How many words will I write each day ? 1000 . <p> Step two : What 's the minimum number of words I must write each day ? 100 . <p> Step three : How long will the challenge be ? One month ( during October ) . <p> Step four : Will there be any off days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let others know about the challenge to keep myself honest ? I will be doing this by recording it on this blog throughout the month . <p> Step six : How will I keep track and record my daily word count throughout the challenge ? I will do it here on this blog . <p> If Im successful with the challenge , I will have written a minimum of 31,000 words by the end of the month . Going by past experience , even if I do n't  reach the goal , I should write more than I would have without the challenge as long as I continue it for the entire 31 days . That 's a vitally important point for all these challenges . While you should do your best to achieve the goal , the true benefit from these type of challenges is to get you writing on a daily basis , and to write more than you would have if you had n't  undertaken the challenge in the first place . <p> So I put forth this challenge to all those reading this now . Commit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see what you can produce . If you have any questions along the way , feel free to ask them in the comments of any challenge article . While I 'm doing this to keep me accountable for the number of words I write this month , I also want to try and help any writer who is having problems writing consistently over a period of time . <p> Below are a list of articles Ive put together as part fo this challenge on tips and hints you may be able to incorporate into your own writing habits to increase your productivity : 
@@12747249 @1347249/ <h> Year : 2016 <p> There were a number of articles that made the claim that Donald Trump spoke at a fourth grade level . They made this determination by running the different candidates presidential announcement speeches through the Flesch " Kincaid readability test . The problem with using a prepared speech is that there 's a good chance that a speech is n't how the candidates actually talk . There 's even a good chance the speech was written by a speech writer instead of the candidate . A better way to determine the speaking level of the candidates would be to analyze them talking in a non-speech setting . <p> It should be noted there are some limitations to the speaking level designations found below . The Dale " Chall readability formula gives a general approximation to the candidates speaking level , but it is n't conclusive . The candidates likely move among levels depending on where and when they are speaking . This was also a single debate where many of the topics use words outside the 3,000 core words that are the foundation of the formula . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be much lower than was found in this debate . <p> These were the results : <h> Donald Trump Speaking Level <p> Donald trump ended up with a 7th to 8th grade speaking level which is better than a 4th grade level , but it was still the lowest of the four candidates . He also spoke the most words during the debate ( 5,520 ) , but used the fewest number of unique words ( 933 ) . Ted Cruz spoke the fewest number of words ( 3,831 ) , but had 70 more ( 1,003 ) unique words than Trump . John Kasich had almost the same number of unique words ( 940 ) as Trump , but spoke over 1,500 fewer words than Trump did during the debate . <h> Ted Cruz Speaking Level <p> Ted Cruz spoke the fewest number of words during the debate ( 3,831 ) , but had the highest speaking level ( 11th to 12th grade ) of the four candidates . The length of his sentences were also the longest at 16 words ( tied with Kasich ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more words than Cruz during the debate . He had 3,852 words compared to 3,831 for Cruz . These were both over 1,600 words fewer than Trump . Kasichs speaking level came in between Trump on the low end and Cruz at the high end with a 9th to 10th grade level . <h> Marco Rubio Speaking Level <p> Marco Rubio ended up speaking the second highest number of words during the debate . He clocked in with 4,969 which was 551 words fewer than Trump . He , like Kasich , ended up with a mid speaking level at 9th to 10th grade . <p> Even though these stats show Trump uses higher than a 4th grade speaking level when his speeches are n't  prepared , he does speak like a junior high school student while all the other candidates he s running against speak at a high school level . <p> One of the popular features on WordCounter is the goal setter ( button right above the text input area ) . This allows users to set a word count goal which allows them to see their progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a lot of people do n't  notice is that there is actually a way to embed this counter into a website or blog allowing others to also see how you 're progressing on your word count goals . <p> To embed the free word count tracker , all you need to do is click on the earth icon to the right of the tracker once you have set a goal . Hovering over this icon , you 'll see the words " Embed this ! " Once you click on it , you 'll be given a couple of choices on the appearance of your word count tracker . You can choose the size ( small , medium or large ) and the color ( blue , red , green , yellow , pink , cyan , brown , purple or orange ) . Once you 've made these two choices , you simply click on the " save and get code " button . This will give you code that you can then place on your blog or website . <p> One of the advantages of this word count tracker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have written to update the counter . As you add words to your writing in the text area on WordCounter , the tracker will automatically update . This allows others to know how you 're doing in real time toward your writing goals . <p> There are a couple of ways you might want to use this . For example , if you write blog articles and you have a daily goal of writing 1000 words a day , you can begin writing each day and people will be able to see where you 're at during the course of the day ( and whether you meet your goal ) . Then you can begin from zero the next morning and continue to repeat day after day . <p> If you have a longer piece of writing , you can set the goal as much larger . For example , maybe your goal is to write 50,000 words for a single project . You can set up the tracker for this amount and everyone will be able to see how your are progressing toward the longer-term goal . <p> No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a great way to keep you accountable to the writing goals you set for yourself . Stating your writing goals and placing them out there so all can see is a great way to keep yourself honest , and it can be a great motivator to write on a daily basis . If you truly want to get a good amount of writing done daily ( or over a longer period of time ) using one of these trackers is an excellent way to do so . <p> I usually have a minimum writing goal of 500 words a day , although I sometimes increase it for certain periods when I need to be extra productive . You can see the tracker I use below . <p> If you listen to a National Basketball Association ( NBA ) game on television or the radio , there 's a good chance that at some point during the telecast , you 'll hear the announcers say that a player is " dropping a dime " or some similar variation of that sentence . You can sometimes see the reference in commercials with basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its meaning , it sounds strange and out of place and the chances are you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about . <h> What is a " dime " referring to in basketball ? <p> A " dime " in basketball is the same thing as an assist . For those unfamiliar , a basketball assist occurs when one player makes a pass to a teammate which leads that teammate to score a basket . By making the pass to the teammate , the player has " assisted " in the making of the basket . <p> Usually , an assist is recorded when a pass is made to the teammate and the teammate then shoots and makes a basket without dribbling the ball , but this is n't a hard-set rule . While this is the case most of the time , there is some judgement involved when considering whether an assist has been made or not . For example , a player who passes to a teammate who is breaking toward the basket and that teammate dribbles once while continuing the cut toward the basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Assists are an important statistic kept for basketball players during each game . Assists are one of the big four statistics ( assists , points scored , steals and blocks ) tallied each game . They 're also recorded on a career level as well as career assists . The statistic is important and valued in basketball because setting up teammates with good passes can lead to easier baskets than for the player to try to score all on their own . <h> Why is an assist called a dime ? <p> The origin of a basketball assist being called a dime is n't readily known . There are a variety of theories , but the most common assumption is that it came from earlier times when pay phones were available across the US . When payphones were most popular ( long before cell phones were the norm ) it cost a dime to make a phone call . If one needed to make a phone call , it was common for that person to ask , " does anyone have a dime ? " In this sense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisting someone to make a phone call . Most people believe this phrase ended up transferring over to the NBA as helping a teammate make a basket . <p> Although " dropping a dime " is considered a positive move for basketball , it does n't  always have positive connotations when used in other circumstances . For example , " dropping a dime " is a way to label a person a snitch or someone who tells on another person . Again , the reference to making a phone call is used as when someone tells ( calls ) authorities to inform someone has broken the law , thus snitching on them . <p> Another popular theory is that it comes from the phrases " dropping it on a dime , " " turning on a dime , " " at a drop of a dime , " and " stopping on a dime . " These phrases all refer to precision , doing it quickly and without hesitation all characteristics of most assists in basketball . A quick pass right on the mark to a teammate will assist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively simple question has , in fact , no single answer . For those looking for a general answer to the question , " How many pages are there in the bible ? " the answer would be " The average bible has around 1,200 pages . " This is a general approximation and there are a lot of factors which can make the number of pages of a particular bible be much less or much more than this number . Anyone seeking a definitive answer to the question of the number of pages in the bible needs to realize that a combination of variables can come into play . <h> What books of the bible have been included ? <p> If one were to take a look at the Catholic bible , for example , the additional books of the Apocrypha ( religious texts not found in most bibles ) would have to be included . The Apocrypha alone would add a substantial number of pages when compared to a standard bible , such as the King James edition . <p> While most bibles do not include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New and Old testaments . Unfortunately , the rule does not apply to The Living Bible . This version of the bible only includes the New Testament . A bible of this nature would end up having far fewer pages . Since different bible editions include different writings , each edition differs in the number of pages it has . <h> The format of the bible <p> Bibles with no pages are more common than you think . In some circles , bibles with no pages are quite the rage . Electronic or digital versions of the bible , without any physical pages , can be easily acquired be being downloaded from the internet or shared via memory cards , CDs etc . <p> But there are other factors that influence the number of pages found in any bible . Font , spacing , page width and height ; margins and other print related issues would most certainly cause variation in the number of pages in a bible ( and why most teachers make assignments by word count instead of page count ) . A large font , typed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opposite approach , using a small font with single spacing , would require fewer pages . The exact same bible with the exact same number of words will often have a different number of pages depending on how the publisher took these into account . <h> The specific version of the bible <p> Certain languages and translations will also impact on how many pages there are in the bible . Great discrepancies can occur even among similar versions . The King James Version of the bible may have more pages than the Revised Standard Version or the New American Standard Version . <p> Because the number of pages in different bibles varies so dramatically , the name of the book in the bible being referenced , the chapter and verse number help us to be " on the same page " when discussing a biblical text . Biblical scholars realized that different versions and translations of the bible could impede research . Page 20 of my King James Version may be completely different to page 20 of your more modern version . This would lead to confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more accurate . In fact , you can go to an exact phrase in the bible . Its a system applauded by scholars . <h> On average , how many pages are in the bible ? <p> If you took a run of the mill , everyday bible , and you managed to count all the pages , you would have the following : <p> The Old Testament has 929 chapters . It has 23,214 verses which comprise roughly 622,700 words . The New Testament consists of 260 chapters , divided into 7,959 verses or roughly 184,600 words . This would give our typical bible 1,189 chapters . These are made up of 31,173 verses and using a rough word count , this amounts to 807,370 words , although the King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> Using a standard font , the average bible has around 1,200 pages . As a book , the bible is as thick as " The Lord of the Rings " and similar fantasy novel epics . The difference is that the bible contains history and philosophy , and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the best answer you will ever get to this question . <p> One of the things most writers would like to be able to do is to write more on a daily basis . While the obvious answer to this problem is to spend more time writing , that 's not always an option . If you like to write or you have a book project brewing in the back of your mind , there are some steps you can take other than to spend more time which has the potential of helping you to get more words down on paper each day . <h> Set goals and stick to them <p> If you 're writing a book , you should have an outline of your plot and your chapters in advance . How far do you want to get this week ? What should your daily progress be ? Set a realistic goal and stick to it even when the going gets tough . <p> Set milestones , and decide how you 'll celebrate them . Turn it into a game or a challenge . If you know how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask a little more of yourself . Are you writing 1,000 words a day ? Push it to 1,250 , it only takes a few minutes longer , but in four days you 'll have gained an extra days worth of progress . Researchers say that we can boost our productivity by as much as 25% just by setting goals . <h> Use your most productive working time <p> Many of us find that we progress fastest with our writing in the mornings . Your brains still half asleep , but somehow its still fresher and you get more writing done . Other people like to write after everyone has gone to sleep . Try writing at different times of the day to determine your most productive time of day and plan your writing time around that . <h> Use down-time to think things through <p> Use times when you 're not writing to think about what you 're going to do next . Stirring a pot in the kitchen does n't  occupy your brain , so use the time to think about where you 're going with your writing . Generate ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town on errands . Even if you do n't  record your thoughts , you 'll have a greater sense of purpose when next you sit down to write . <h> Do n't  try to perfect your writing when you 're in an inspired space <p> Nobody can be inspired all the time , but when inspiration hits , the faster you can get your ideas down , the more you 're going to get out of the moment . You can always go back and correct things later on , but your inspiration wont last forever . So write . Be fast . Be furious . Be glaringly inaccurate . You can fix all of that when your brain reverts to plodding along . <h> Use writing prompts <p> If you 're blogging , journaling or just writing for fun , getting ideas for something to write can take nearly as much time as the writing itself . There are tons of weird , wonderful , interesting or inspiring writing prompts available online . Pick one at random and go crazy . The creative challenges will sharpen up your thinking , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Take breaks <p> Spending hours at a time hammering away at your writing might not be the best way to boost your productivity . Take breaks every 25 minutes or so , even if its just getting a glass of water or looking up from your work and doing a few stretching exercises . Its a scientifically proven fact that people who cut themselves some slack in the form of short breaks are way more productive than the constant plodders . <h> Do n't  dump your workout <p> Forget the stereotypes of lumbering ( and slightly dim ) muscle men and ditzy gym bunnies . Getting exercise improves your circulation and gets extra oxygen into your bloodstream . And that goes to your brain , helping you to think more creatively and effectively . A study on creative thinking showed that people who did exercise , even light exercise , fared better at a task set to measure creative thinking . <h> Figure out how you waste time <p> Relaxing is important , but a lot of the unproductive things we do in our free time are n't  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we aimlessly search the net or we engage in less-than-meaningful interactions on social media . Remember , if it relaxes and refreshes you , its productive . If it does n't  , it might be that cutting out that activity will give you more time to boost your writing productivity . <h> Shut out distractions <p> Do people ping you on Skype while you 're writing ? Do you have your Facebook tab open and peep to see what 's going down every time you hear a notifier ? You could be losing hours of productive time just attending to these little distractions . When you return to your work , you have to compose your thoughts all over again , and that wastes time too . <h> Drink lots of water <p> This might sound like just another of those ho-hum health tips , but it really works . Think about it . Your body consists mainly of water , and your brain has an even higher percentage of water than the rest of your body . If you 're dehydrated , which many of us are as a matter of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its best ? Keep a glass of water handy , and keep on sipping ! <p> When you write an article or manuscript for a magazine , you 'll usually be asked to hit a predetermined word count . There would seem to be nothing complicated about this . Its the exact reason we created WordCounter . You place your writing into the text area and you instantly know the number of words you have typed . One would assume that magazine editors and other publishers would n't have any issue with this number . The problem is that they likely will . <p> Why is an accurate word count not useful to many publishers ? There is a simple reason that may not seem obvious at first , but it makes a lot of sense once its pointed out . Below is the reasons why we decided it was important to include a publisher word count in the details section for those who will be submitting their writing for publication . <h> Word Length <p> Word Counter counts the individual words written . " He is at a big park " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem for publishers is the six words take up 19 character spaces ( 20 if you place a period at the end ) while the single word takes up 34 character spaces . While the length of the words will even itself out to a certain degree over the length of ones writing , each writer will still produce different length articles even when they have the same word count . <p> When a publisher asks for a certain number of words , they are doing so in anticipation the writing will be the length needed to fill the space allotted for the article . Its the space the article fills which is of the utmost importance to the publisher , not the actual word count . The problem is that explaining to the writer the exact length can be complicated , so they give a word count and hope that produces writing that fills the space allotted for the article . An article with unusually long words would likely go over the anticipated length , while an article with many short words would fall short of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things a bit more accurate , there 's actually a publishers specific word count . Instead of counting each individual word , publishers have agreed upon the definition that a " word " is six characters long including blank spaces . This solves the issue of words being different lengths and gives a much more accurate estimate of space an article will use as compared to simply counting individual words . Using this definition , " He is at a big park . " would be three and one-third words ( including the period ) . On the other hand , " **34;867;TOOLONG " would be five and one-third words . <p> The Word Counter Publisher Count calculates a word to be six character spaces and applies it to your writing to come up with its total . This is n't perfect for publishers , but its a lot more accurate than counting individual words . If you are submitting work to a publisher , you can ask which of the two methods they would prefer when you attach a word count total to your submission . <p> When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify not writing . One of the most common excuses is writers block ( whether that really exists or not ) . Therere few things worse than wanting to write but nothing seems to come out . I 've found over the years that one of the best ways for me to tackle writers block is to step away from whatever I happen to be working on at that moment , and just get myself writing again . For me , if I can begin to write anything , then the words begin to flow on the original project where the writers block started . <p> One of the best ways to do this is through creative writing prompts . These appeal to me mainly because they are fresh ideas and I do n't  have the inhibition of writing badly since I know I 'm the only one who is going to be reading them . The problem is finding new writing ideas to prompt me into writing . With that in mind , and knowing others may also be in a similar situation as I , here are some creative writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 Creative Writing Prompts <p> When it comes to these writing prompts , there are no rules to how you should write . Whether you decide to write a short story , a poem , an essay a haiku or any other form , the main objective is to simply begin writing .

Or have any of the above prompts made you think of new ones that could benefit other writers ? Feel free to share any writing prompts youd like and well add them to this list ! <p> When it comes to writing essays , there are two frequent issues that arise ; the word count is either too low or too high for the stated range of the essay . For those who perpetually end up with too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase your essay word count . For those who frequently find themselves with too many words on the page , there are some simple steps to take when editing to help reduce the number of words while at the same time making it a stronger piece of writing . Below are some suggestions to do this . <h> Rank Your Arguments <p> If you find you 're well above your word count maximum , the first step is to rank the points you use to substantiate your argument . By ranking the importance of the arguments you make in the essay , you can eliminate ones which are n't  as important as others , keeping the essay strong while removing large portions of writing . If you do n't  want to eliminate any of the points , you can still reduce word count by mentioning all the arguments , but not writing as much detail about those not as strong as the more important points . <h> Focus on the Main Point <p> Once you determine what the important arguments are for your essay , read through it looking for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or topic . Its easy to accidentally go off on tangents when writing , and eliminating these tangents can help reduce word count . The more focused you can remain on your topic and arguments , the more concise your writing will be . <h> Use the Best Verb <p> This may sound obvious , but a lot of writers do n't  do this well . When writing , always use the perfect verb rather than one that 's close , but not perfect . When you use the best verb possible , it will reduce the amount of writing you do in most cases . This is due to the fact that when you use a verb that 's not quite correct , you usually need to add more words to clarify your meaning . here 's an example : <p> " They beat the opposing team by a lot of points . " <p> While " beat " is accurate in this case , its not the perfect verb because they not only beat the team , they beat the team by a lot . Using the better verb " trounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still giving the same meaning as the longer sentence . <p> " They trounced the opposing team . " <h> Remove Adverbs <p> Look through your essay and see if you find any adverbs , especially adverbs which have " ly " endings . In many instances , these adverbs end up being filler words which end up being placed in the writing because its the way we talk , but the words do n't  add anything beneficial to the actual essay . Go through the essay and ask if each one is needed and remove those that are n't  . Some words you may want to look out for are ( click on image to expand to see better ) <h> Remove Adjectives <p> Much in the same way as adverbs make their way into writing , multiple adjectives are used when one ( or none at all ) would suffice . Read the essay to see if all of the adjectives used are needed , and remove those which do n't  add to the meaning of the sentence being written . Some common adjectives to look for are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some words that can be confusing as to which is the correct one to use . A good example of this confusion is further versus farther . Another common word duo many people have difficulty knowing which is correct is who and whom . <p> Very few people bother to use the word whom in spoken English , but when were writing , we want to use the correct grammar . Since we so seldom use whom , we are n't  always sure when it is the right choice , or when we should stick to the familiar who instead . <p> Most experts agree that if we are unsure , who is a safer bet . And its fine for informal writing after all whom is slowly disappearing from our language . However , if we have to produce formal written work , we do need to know when to use the mysterious whom . Put it in the wrong places , and you 'll look pompous and silly . Omit it when you should have used it , and you 'll look unprofessional if your error is picked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that governs the use of whom , and then , to make it easier for you , well look at a little cheat that you can use to test a sentence when you are n't  sure which of the two words belongs . <h> The rule governing the use of who and whom <p> Look at the verb in your sentence . Is who performing the action ? If so , who is the right choice to make . So who is the subject of a verb the one who is the doer ! <p> Who is there ? <p> Do you know who will attend the conference ? <p> Who threw that snowball ? <p> I got hit by a snowball and I want to know who threw it ! <p> This is the man who won the prize . <p> Youve probably already guessed that since you choose who when the person you 're referring to is the subject of your verb , you 'll use whom when the person becomes the object of the verb . The object is acted on by the verb rather than being the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out last night ? <p> We will inform those whom we shortlist . <p> Be selective about those whom you choose as friends . <p> To whom should the invoice be sent ? <h> An easy cheat <p> Although we tend to be confused about when to use the word who and the contexts in which whom is the correct choice , were much more familiar with the words he and him and they and them . We instinctively know which of the words in these pairs fit into any sentence . <p> You will have noticed that whom , him and them all end in the letter m , and the rule for choosing them or him rather than they or he is exactly the same as it is for who and whom . By playing around with the sentence you plan to write , substituting he or him for who or whom you can get a pointer that tells you which of the two words will be correct . Of course , that wo n't work as well for questions , but in that case , you can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointer . <p> Question : Who / Whom is knocking on the door ? Answer : He is knocking . <p> So now we know that the right word to use in the question is who . <p> I met three men , one of who / whom is an astronaut . I met three men , one of them is an astronaut . <p> In this case , whom matches them and would be the correct word to use . <p> Unfortunately , our little cheat does n't  always work as easily as it does in the above examples . If you find yourself struggling , you 'll have to return to your verb so you can decide whether who / whom is the subject or object of the verb . Always remember a subject performs the action indicated by the verb while the object is on the receiving end . <p> You can also look at where your prepositions are located . Whom often follows a preposition . For example : <p> With whom <p> Of whom <p> Beside whom <p> After whom <p> Around whom <h> Still worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use who and when we use whom are not clear to the majority of people . Unless you are writing a formal document , you can choose who and hope for the best . But if you can master the who / whom distinction , you 'll be ahead of the pack , and that 's always a great place to be . <p> There are times when English can be confusing , even to native speakers who learned the language from the cradle . One of the common areas of confusion arises when we have to choose between two words which seem to be almost the same . Learning to properly understand the different uses of different words is one aspect of improving your vocabulary . <p> For example , the question whether to use " further away " or " farther away " can be confusing . They look very similar , and their meanings are similar too . When were talking , few people would even notice the difference , but when were writing , we need to be more precise and choose our words carefully . How will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use " farther ? " Luckily , there 's a very simple way to work it out when you proofread your writing . Its the difference between literal distance and figurative distance . <h> Distances can be literal or figurative <p> When we refer to distance , it can be either literal or figurative . For example : <p> " How much farther will we have to drive to reach our hotel ? " <p> In this example , the person asking the question is looking for a literal distance . They want to know how many miles they will have to travel to reach their destination . " Farther " is completely correct in this context . <p> In the following example , our distance is figurative : <p> " Would you like me to explain this further ? " <p> Obviously , the answer here ca n't be " Five miles " because we are n't  looking at a literal distance . <p> The good news is there 's a simple and useful trick to remembering the difference . To make your life easier , you can remember the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllable , " Far . " Now think of all the distance measurements . There are miles , kilometers , centimeters , inches and so on . Would you associate these measurements with what you are going to say ? If so , then " farther " is the word you should be choosing in order to be 100% correct . <p> Now consider " further " as being an " add-on " : <p> " You can have a further $5 . " " It will be a further year before you finish your studies . " " I was further insulted by her rude behavior on Sunday . " <p> It tells you that something extra is going to be added . <h> Interchangeability : just to make you more confused <p> Now that we have a clear explanation of when to use the word " farther " rather than " further " its time to muddy the waters a little . Although you should n't use " farther " at times when " further " is the more appropriate choice , there are times when you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even some who advise you to choose " further " when in doubt . <p> People have been using these two words interchangeably for a long time , and in other parts of the world where English is spoken , " further " is used much more often , while few people use " farther " at all . But if you want to fit in with accepted modern American grammar , its important to remember the simple distinction between the literal distance " farther " and the figurative distance " further . " If you are writing a report or an essay , you need to choose the correct word , and the usages weve just discussed are accepted as correct in both the Chicago Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook . <p> But there are still cases in American grammar in which we will find that the two words are interchangeable . For instance : <p> " How much farther do you have to read ? " and " How much further do you have to read ? " would both be correct . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still need to read to finish the book , or you could be asking if they will have to read more books or more chapters to get the information they need . In the first example , you 're asking for a literal distance in the number of pages . In the second example , you 're asking for a figurative distance . As with so many other grammar rules , context is very important . <p> Let 's keep it simple . If reading this has made you more confused than ever , then just hold onto this thought : <p> " Farther " is a distance and " further " is something extra . How easy is that ? 
@@12747250 @1347250/ <h> 25 Excuses for Not Writing ( And Why Theyre Not Valid ) <p> Writers ( and those who want to be writers ) have tons of excuses for not writing . I 'm not sure there 's any other occupation with quite so many excuses for not working as writing . Everyone from school kids who have to write a term paper to novelists and freelance writers have piles of excuses for not doing the work . <p> Worse , many writers and would-be-writers have convinced themselves that these excuses are valid . While some of them may be valid on a limited basis ( if you 're sick , injured , or in the middle of some kind of true crisis , for example , you may really not be able to write ) , most of them are just ways we try to justify our fears , insecurities , or laziness . They 're nothing but excuses , not legitimate reasons for skipping work . To help you sort out valid from invalid excuses , here are some of the most common excuses writers give for not working and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time <p> Everybodys busy . We all have errands to run , jobs to do , family to take care of , volunteer assignments , and appointments to keep . If everyone was " too busy " to write , we 'd never have another book published . If writing is something you want to do , you have to make it a priority . Drop whatever obligations you can get out of , delegate stuff to other people , and let the dishes sit in the sink for a little longer . <h> My family will hate me <p> This excuse comes up on two fronts . The first is that your family will hate you if you use real-life experiences in your work . They wo n't like seeing themselves in print . And they probably wo n't . But you can change names and alter events to protect the innocent . If they still get mad , well , you can hope that your royalty checks are enough to shut them up . The second fear is that your family will hate you if you start making writing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time as they 're used to and they might ( gasp ) have to start doing some more things for themselves . That 's not a bad thing . You can work out compromises as you go along to make sure they do n't  feel left out . <h> I 'm too old to start <p> " You cant get published if you 're over forty . Publishers only want hot young authors who are TV worthy . " Or , " They wo n't take a chance on an old guy who wont live to give them thirty books . " Sometimes this is ( sadly ) true . But its even more true that publishers are businesses that want excellent products to sell . If you 've got a great story well told or an original non-fiction book , theyll want it , even if you 've got one foot in the grave and its the only book you 're likely to ever write . <h> I 'm too young to start <p> Yes , sometimes young authors lack experience and training and that comes through in their work , leading to rejections . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer and more successful your career can be . <h> No one will take me seriously <p> They may not . Your work may be ridiculed and pushed aside . Or it may not . You wo n't know unless you try . And unless your goal is to be a great literary author or the author of a serious non-fiction book , being taken seriously does n't  matter all that much , anyway . <h> I 've got writers block <p> There is no such thing as writers block . If you ca n't think of a single thing to put on the page , you 've got a very big problem and it probably means you 've gone blind , deaf , and mute as well . With everything that goes on around you every day and all that has happened in your life , you should always be able to find something to write about . Whether what you write is good or not is a separate problem , but its not writers block . <h> Itll never be published <p> Maybe not , but is publication the only reason you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy it , because you like to tell stories , or because you like to learn new things ? If so , so what if you do n't  get published ? Writing is often its own reward and publication is just icing on the cake . <h> I have no talent <p> You may not . Lots of people do n't  . But anyone can learn to write better . Spend some time in classes and working with a good writers group or mentor . You can get better . It may not be so much a lack of talent as you just do n't  know the mechanics very well . At least try to improve before you write yourself off as a no-talent hack . <h> I 'm saving it for when I retire/have more free time/the kids are gone <p> Sure . And something else will always insert itself into that , " free time . " Besides , what if you drop dead before you can retire , or what if the kids never leave ? You have to write now , not put it off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> I do n't  have any good ideas <p> Ideas are all over the place , you just have to learn how to recognize them and then turn that tiny fragment of an idea into a story or article . Everything that you read , watch , see , hear , or smell has the potential to be a good idea . <h> There are too many interruptions <p> You can move your work area to someplace less distracting like the library . Turn off the phone and refuse to answer the door . Buy some noise-canceling headphones . Turn off your internet connection and email notifications . If the kids wont leave you alone , drop them off at the movies for a couple of hours . Dump them on your spouse for the afternoon and go to the library . Distractions can be managed if you 're motivated . <h> I need an MFA before I can write <p> Yes , you might need some more training before your work is publishable . Chances are , though , that you can learn what you need through an extension course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own . An MFA is nice , but very few people " need " one at all , much less need to complete one before they can write at all . After all , if you cant write without it , how are you going to get into the program in the first place ? <h> The last thing I wrote was rejected <p> Every writer is rejected . Most of them get rejected a lot . Even writers that are now legends like J.K. Rowling were rejected . Its not always a matter of your work being bad . Sometimes its just that the particular publisher did n't  need what you 're selling , or that they already have something similar on their list . You have to keep writing and submitting . <h> There 's not a market for what I want to write <p> True , it can be harder to get work published that does n't  fit into an established genre . But someone has to be the first to start a new trend . It could be you . <h> I 'm too tired and stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed earlier . Try writing in the morning while you 're still fresh . Drop some obligations to reduce your stress . Figure out what 's stressing you and then work to eliminate or control it . Exercise to burn off some anger and increase your energy levels . Eat right to keep your overall health in balance . Everyone is tired and stressed but you have to learn how to get things under control so that you can be productive . <h> People will laugh at me <p> They might . Generally , though , most people are too absorbed in themselves to care about what you 're doing . And no publisher or agent is going to call you up and laugh at your submission to your face . They 're too busy to bother laughing at you . You 'll just get a polite rejection with no laughter . <h> The whole thing is just too hard <p> If its just too hard to write and go through the process of submitting and revising your work , you 're in the wrong line of work . Writing is a job and , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , we 'd all be getting six-figure royalty checks . <h> Ill never finish , so why start ? <p> This speaks to a problem with completion . Do you finish other things you start ? If so , then writing just is n't important enough to you to finish . Think about whether its something you want to do . If you never finish anything , then you 've got a bigger problem you have to solve before you can write or do anything else successfully . Regardless , starting is worthwhile because you might discover that this is the one thing you do finish . <h> I 'd rather be doing something else <p> Then go do it . Writing is either important enough to you that you will forego other activities , or its not . If you do n't  want to do it , do n't  . If you want to write , you 'll put your butt in the chair and do the work . Otherwise you 'll go to the movies and let other peoples work populate the bookshelves . <h> I do n't  know how to get published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn . There are plenty of books and magazines to help you and in the age of the Internet , the answer to any question is one Google away . There are also extension classes dedicated to the publishing process . Write the story or book first , then worry about what comes next . <h> I have nothing new to say <p> If everything on the market had to be 100% original , we could all stop writing right now . There is very little that has n't  already been covered . What matters is how you present your material . Is your voice unique ? Do you have a slightly different angle on an old problem ? Can you improve on something someone has already done ? <h> I 'm not an expert on anything <p> You do n't  have to be . You can learn what you need to know as you go along . Sure , publishers like people who are well established in their fields , but you have a chance even if you 're not that guy . If you are professional and have something original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make yourself an expert . Start writing for smaller publications and work your way up . By the time you get to the upper echelon of publications , you 'll be an expert . <h> I 'm not web savvy <p> It helps if you know how to set up a blog or website , and if you can promote yourself on Facebook and Twitter . But you can either learn these things as you go along , or hire someone to handle them for you . There are plenty of writers who pay someone to maintain their websites or presence on social media . There are also plenty of writers whove gone to classes to learn about these things . <h> I cant handle failure ( or success ) <p> And if you never write , you wont have to , now will you ? That 's the allure of this excuse . But if you ca n't handle failure or success in your writing , how can you handle anything that happens to you ? Do you freak out if you get promoted at work ? Probably not . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the way you hoped ? Probably not . The good news is that failure or success in writing is rarely life-threatening . So your story does n't  get published ? You had a good time writing it , did n't  you ? And you probably werent counting on the money just yet . So try again . And if you succeed , the odds are very low that you 'll succeed to the point that the paparazzi are camping outside your door and the phone is ringing day and night with people wanting interviews . <h> I work full-time and have to take care of the house/kids/pets , too <p> Again , you need to prioritize your time . Can you write on your lunch hour ? Are the kids old enough that they can be dropped at a friends house for a couple of hours ? Can they carpool with someone else in their activities once a week so you do n't  have to drive them ? And if you do drive them , can you take your laptop and write while you wait ? Do you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you hire a housekeeper who comes in once a month to deal with the worst of the housework ? You have to have time for the things that are important to you , whether its writing or something else . Otherwise you 'll go bonkers . Figure out how to carve that time out of your schedule . <p> If you find yourself offering up excuse after excuse , it might be time to reevaluate your career choice . You probably shouldnt be a writer . If you really want to write , however , you have to realize that these excuses are just that . Excuses . And they 're probably hiding something else like fear , insecurity , or even something like depression . It may be that you really do n't  want to be a writer . If you deal with the root problem , your excuses will likely go away .

While the word may sound like horderves , this is not the correct spelling . The correct spelling of horderves is hors doeuvres . <p> Of course , its not always necessary to know how to spell the foods you serve . Nobody is going to know you do n't  know how to spell the word correctly when you say " horderves " as you place out appetizers .

@@12747253 @1347253/ <h> How Many Words Are in a Novel ? <p> If you have decided this is the year you 're going to write that novel you 've always told yourself you want to write , one aspect you need to consider when putting it together is how long it should be ( if you want the best chance to get the novel published ) . There are no hard and fast rules on how long a novel should be if you 're writing for your own pleasure . But if you 're hoping to get it into print , publishers have certain expectations . Knowing what these are will give you a goal to shoot for when you plan your chapters and begin to write . Trying to get an unusually short book or an exceptionally long one published is something you should leave until you 've made a name for yourself . <p> When considering novels , its important to note there are a large variety of genres . As a general guideline , well include romances , thrillers , detective stories and attempts to make a mark in the world of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly other types of novels ( see science fiction and fantasy below ) , this should cover most of these . So , how many words should there be in a novel you want to get published ? Novels should be between 80,000 to 90,000 words . <p> Publishers like to see 80,000 to just under 90,000 words for the average adult novel . 70,000 to just under 80,000 could be accepted , but might be seen as being a trifle too short . Anything less than 70,000 words is definitely too short . Novels over 100,000 words are getting to be on the long side . Anything over 110,000 words will almost certainly be considered too long by an agent or publisher . <p> The reason for the upper limit is that printing costs increase once you exceed that word count . That 's not to say that books as long or longer havent been successfully printed , but agents would regard something that ambitious as an epic or a saga , and unless you 're already well known , an overly lengthy book could hurt your chances of finding an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit is based on reader preferences . Are you giving your reader enough meat so they find the book satisfying ? Unless you 're producing a very light read , probably not . Once again , trying to push the lower limits for a novel is best attempted once you already have a following and are making your publisher a lot of money . <p> Science Fiction and Fantasy novels break the above word count rules and can be longer How many words are there in a Sci-Fi or Fantasy novel ? Science Fiction and Fantasy books should be 90,000 to 125,000 words . <p> The acceptance of a more ambitious word count in these two genres is the need to describe whole new worlds and ( presumably ) original concepts . The issue to remember is the caveat about printing costs . When you 're going into print for the first time , you 're generally considered a bad risk , so going over 110,000 words might cause your publisher to have second thoughts .

I think everyone should write their novel as if it were just for them . Then , when finished , if it feels like one that should be published , you can edit to the word count needed . Writing for the word count at the beginning will create an inferior novel in my opinion . <p> Most people who write novels are n't  writing them just for themselves . They are writing them in hopes that the novel will be published . And therefore knowing the acceptable word count for a novel is important . I think you are in the minority of writing just for yourself . <p> I do n't  think it should matter how many words a novel has as long as its good . I think the book industry does writers disservice by mandating how many words a novel can be instead of reading the writing and deciding if the novel is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but the book industry knows what sells and is profitable . Sure , there may be exceptions , but it is n't worth them taking the risk with these with the number they publish . If you do n't  like the publishers rules , then do n't  try to publish through one of them . Do it on your own . <p> I understand why people say not to worry about the number of words in a novel , but if you ever want to get it published , you do have to know what publishers will and wont accept . Thinking that your novel does n't  need to abide by the rules of other novelists is a sure sign you are n't  ever going to g yours published . You may be able to get away with it if you are successful , but as a first timer , good luck with that ! <p> This .

If you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and write as many words as you want .

@@12747255 @1347255/ <h> Month : February 2016 <p> What may appear to be a relatively simple question has , in fact , no single answer . For those looking for a general answer to the question , " How many pages are there in the bible ? " the answer would be " The average bible has around 1,200 pages . " This is a general approximation and there are a lot of factors which can make the number of pages of a particular bible be much less or much more than this number . Anyone seeking a definitive answer to the question of the number of pages in the bible needs to realize that a combination of variables can come into play . <h> What books of the bible have been included ? <p> If one were to take a look at the Catholic bible , for example , the additional books of the Apocrypha ( religious texts not found in most bibles ) would have to be included . The Apocrypha alone would add a substantial number of pages when compared to a standard bible , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the Apocrypha , they are at least comprised of both the New and Old testaments . Unfortunately , the rule does not apply to The Living Bible . This version of the bible only includes the New Testament . A bible of this nature would end up having far fewer pages . Since different bible editions include different writings , each edition differs in the number of pages it has . <h> The format of the bible <p> Bibles with no pages are more common than you think . In some circles , bibles with no pages are quite the rage . Electronic or digital versions of the bible , without any physical pages , can be easily acquired be being downloaded from the internet or shared via memory cards , CDs etc . <p> But there are other factors that influence the number of pages found in any bible . Font , spacing , page width and height ; margins and other print related issues would most certainly cause variation in the number of pages in a bible ( and why most teachers make assignments by word count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typed in bold and with double spacing would obviously require more pages . The opposite approach , using a small font with single spacing , would require fewer pages . The exact same bible with the exact same number of words will often have a different number of pages depending on how the publisher took these into account . <h> The specific version of the bible <p> Certain languages and translations will also impact on how many pages there are in the bible . Great discrepancies can occur even among similar versions . The King James Version of the bible may have more pages than the Revised Standard Version or the New American Standard Version . <p> Because the number of pages in different bibles varies so dramatically , the name of the book in the bible being referenced , the chapter and verse number help us to be " on the same page " when discussing a biblical text .

In fact , you can go to an exact phrase in the bible . Its a system applauded by scholars . <h> On average , how many pages are in the bible ? <p> If you took a run of the mill , everyday bible , and you managed to count all the pages , you would have the following : <p> The Old Testament has 929 chapters . It has 23,214 verses which comprise roughly 622,700 words . The New Testament consists of 260 chapters , divided into 7,959 verses or roughly 184,600 words . This would give our typical bible 1,189 chapters . These are made up of 31,173 verses and using a rough word count , this amounts to 807,370 words , although the King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> Using a standard font , the average bible has around 1,200 pages .

If you like to write or you have a book project brewing in the back of your mind , there are some steps you can take other than to spend more time which has the potential of helping you to get more words down on paper each day . <h> Set goals and stick to them <p> If you 're writing a book , you should have an outline of your plot and your chapters in advance .

Researchers say that we can boost our productivity by as much as 25% just by setting goals . <h> Use your most productive working time <p> Many of us find that we progress fastest with our writing in the mornings . Your brains still half asleep , but somehow its still fresher and you get more writing done . Other people like to write after everyone has gone to sleep . Try writing at different times of the day to determine your most productive time of day and plan your writing time around that . <h> Use down-time to think things through <p> Use times when you 're not writing to think about what you 're going to do next .

You can always go back and correct things later on , but your inspiration wont last forever . So write . Be fast . Be furious . Be glaringly inaccurate . You can fix all of that when your brain reverts to plodding along . <h> Use writing prompts <p> If you 're blogging , journaling or just writing for fun , getting ideas for something to write can take nearly as much time as the writing itself .

Its a scientifically proven fact that people who cut themselves some slack in the form of short breaks are way more productive than the constant plodders . <h> Do n't  dump your workout <p> Forget the stereotypes of lumbering ( and slightly dim ) muscle men and ditzy gym bunnies . Getting exercise improves your circulation and gets extra oxygen into your bloodstream . And that goes to your brain , helping you to think more creatively and effectively .

Do you have your Facebook tab open and peep to see what 's going down every time you hear a notifier ? You could be losing hours of productive time just attending to these little distractions . When you return to your work , you have to compose your thoughts all over again , and that wastes time too . <h> Drink lots of water <p> This might sound like just another of those ho-hum health tips , but it really works .

If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , how can you expect your brain to function at its best ? Keep a glass of water handy , and keep on sipping ! <p> When you write an article or manuscript for a magazine , you 'll usually be asked to hit a predetermined word count . There would seem to be nothing complicated about this . Its the exact reason we created WordCounter . You place your writing into the text area and you instantly know the number of words you have typed . One would assume that magazine editors and other publishers would n't have any issue with this number . The problem is that they likely will . <p> Why is an accurate word count not useful to many publishers ? There is a simple reason that may not seem obvious at first , but it makes a lot of sense once its pointed out . Below is the reasons why we decided it was important to include a publisher word count in the details section for those who will be submitting their writing for publication . <h> Word Length <p> Word Counter counts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park " is six words . " **34;903;TOOLONG " is one word . The problem for publishers is the six words take up 19 character spaces ( 20 if you place a period at the end ) while the single word takes up 34 character spaces . While the length of the words will even itself out to a certain degree over the length of ones writing , each writer will still produce different length articles even when they have the same word count . <p> When a publisher asks for a certain number of words , they are doing so in anticipation the writing will be the length needed to fill the space allotted for the article . Its the space the article fills which is of the utmost importance to the publisher , not the actual word count . The problem is that explaining to the writer the exact length can be complicated , so they give a word count and hope that produces writing that fills the space allotted for the article . An article with unusually long words would likely go over the anticipated length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the length needed by the publisher . <p> To help make things a bit more accurate , there 's actually a publishers specific word count . Instead of counting each individual word , publishers have agreed upon the definition that a " word " is six characters long including blank spaces . This solves the issue of words being different lengths and gives a much more accurate estimate of space an article will use as compared to simply counting individual words . Using this definition , " He is at a big park . " would be three and one-third words ( including the period ) . On the other hand , " **34;939;TOOLONG " would be five and one-third words . <p> The Word Counter Publisher Count calculates a word to be six character spaces and applies it to your writing to come up with its total .

Its there for anyone . <p> Sometimes its just easier to have the idea already presented and write from there rather than think of an idea yourself .

But we know sometimes it can be hard to think of what to write about.You get better at any skill through practice , and creative writing prompts are a great way to practice writing.Dreaming of doing something and starting it , in reality , has a lot of difference . Sometimes we need a push to take the first step . Though some of the top institutes have made it easier for the individuals to learn the skills through short-term writing courses and convert their hobby into their career . <p> What is the best way to choose a writing prompt from this list ? Is it better to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pick a random one and use that ? is one way more effective than the other and if I should choose a random one , how do I choose a random number for this ? 
@@12747257 @1347257/ <h> Tag : Japanese <p> Whether you want to do a word count or a character count , it helps to know the number of letters in the alphabet . Knowing the correct number of letters in the alphabet depends greatly on which languages alphabet you are referring to . While many may assume you 're talking about English , that might not always be the best assumption since there are so many different languages around the world . Below are the answers to this question for some of the more popular world languages . <h> How many letters are there in the English alphabet ? <p> There are 26 letters in the English alphabet which range from a to z ( with b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t , u , v , w , x , and y in between ) . What many people do n't  know is as recently as 200 years ago , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While many probably are familiar with the number of letters in English ( if they are native English speakers ) , they may not be quite as familiar with the numbers in other languages . <h> How many letters are there in the Arabic alphabet ? <p> Those curly letters do look pretty , and there are 28 letters in Arabic just two more than the English alphabet . Sounds simple ? Perhaps not as simple as it looks ! All 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet are consonants . <p> That 's not to say that Arabic does n't  have vowels . It does , but instead of having special letters , vowels are shown by a " diacritical mark " a glyph that 's added to a consonant . Just to make things more confusing , you wo n't always bother with vowels . Theyre essential if you 're quoting the Quran or if you 're writing a book for children , but most of the time , you just leave them out . <h> How many letters are there in the Chinese alphabet ? <p> Now things get really complicated ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " only " need to know three or four thousand characters . And I say " only " because there are literally tens of thousands of Chinese characters . <p> That 's because Chinese does n't  actually have an alphabet at all . Instead of the marks you make representing sounds , they represent ideas ( ideograms ) or pictures ( pictograms ) . And of course , you can combine ideas and get compound pictograms . So the word " good " is represented by the ideogram for " woman " and the ideogram for " child " superimposed on one another . <h> How many letters are there in the Japanese alphabet ? <p> To read Japanese , you 'll need to know about 2,000 symbols from three " alphabets . " The first of these is known as " kanji , " and it consists of pictograms that originated in China . Then there are two phonetic alphabets , " hiragana " and " katakana . " At least these two alphabets actually represent sounds , so they are easier for a foreigner to learn and understand . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters are there in the Korean alphabet ? <p> Westerners may heave a sigh of relief when they hear that the Korean alphabet , known as the Hangul in the South and the Chosangul in the North , consists of 24 characters and there are vowels too . However , we may have some difficulty piecing together some Korean writing , because Korean characters are arranged in blocks that become syllables . So what looks like a single character to us , may be a combination of characters representing a sound . <h> How many letters are there in the Russian alphabet ? <p> Are you eager to learn Russian ? You 'll begin with the alphabet consisting of 33 letters . 10 of these are vowels , 21 are consonants and there are two additional " signs " to learn . Luckily , Russian is a phonetic language , so you can learn what sounds each letter represents and take it from there . <h> How many letters are there in the Spanish alphabet ? <p> English speakers will feel as if they 're on some familiar ground with the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish alphabet . The extra four are ch , ll , + and rr , each of which represents a different sound . And while were talking about sounds , " h " may be vital to spelling , but its a silent letter . <h> How many letters are there in the Italian alphabet ? <p> Although Italian may not be the easiest language in the world if you take grammar into account , the alphabet is a breeze . It only has 21 letters . " Foreign " letters : j , k , w , x and y are borrowed to write foreign words . Spelling is phonetical , but you 'll have to learn a few spelling rules before you can join a spelling bee . <h> How many letters are there in the Greek alphabet ? <p> From Alpha to Omega , were looking at 24 letters in the Greek alphabet . Greek is one of the oldest scripts still in use , and its one of the roots of Latin script that determines how we write today . Once one gets used to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be few problems reading Greek even without understanding it . Its a phonetic language with few tricky vices to throw you off . <h> How many letters are there in the German alphabet ? <p> Despite some formatting differences and the presence of the umlaut , which has different effects on pronunciation depending on where you put it , the German alphabet has the 26 letters that English speakers are used to . Of course , learning an alphabet and learning a language are two different things . Reading German is n't all that difficult once you have some vocabulary , but becoming fluent with it is a different matter . <h> Luckily , there are things that everyone understands <p> Its important to remember that alphabets are n't  everything when it comes to communication . You do n't  have to be a linguist to smile , something everyone understands . The game of charades , which is often the foreigners last resort when verbal communication fails , can also get you through some tight spots . It may not always be effective , but even when it is n't , it usually provokes hilarity at the very least . 
@@12747258 @1347258/ <h> How to Make Sure You Hit Your Writing Deadlines <p> Ever notice how you tend to deal with things that have a due date or an expiration date ( and a punishment for missing that date ) first while you let other things slide ? You read your library books before the books from your own collection because they 're due on a certain date . If you do n't  return them you 'll owe money . You eat the food that 's about to expire even if its not what youd prefer because the uneaten food is a waste of money . You hurry up and finish the project for which you borrowed a neighbors power saw because if you do n't  return the saw on the date you promised , you 'll jeopardize the friendship . You write the article that has a deadline because missing it means no paycheck ( and probably no further work from that publication ) . <p> All of these scenarios have a due date and a punishment attached for missing that date . The deadline and the punishment combine to motivate you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . This aversion to punishment can be used to further your writing career and help defeat procrastination . But what about the problem of not all writing projects having due dates ? When you 're working on your first novel , non-fiction book proposal , or collection of short stories and you do n't  have a contract , how do you impose due dates and punishments ? <p> There are a couple of ways to do this . First , you can simply write the date on your calendar and come up with a punishment that you will impose on yourself if you do n't  make it . Maybe you wo n't take that weekend trip you 've planned and for which youve already paid a non-refundable deposit , or you wo n't go to that concert for which youve already bought tickets . Whatever punishment you choose , it has to hurt . You cant just say , " Oh , I wont watch my favorite TV show . " That 's not enough pain because , really , you can catch the show later . The punishment has to hurt monetarily or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hurting other people , such as by skipping that family trip or backing out of a an event that you promised to organize . <p> And the biggie : You have to stick to the punishment . You cant let yourself off the hook even once . Do it once and you 'll do it every time . You have to go through with whatever punishment you choose or it wont be an effective way to boost your output . You have to choose a punishment that not only hurts , but one which you will actually impose . " Ill throw myself off a cliff if I do n't  finish this book by July 22nd , " is n't realistic . ( Unless you have some serious issues , in which case you need a mental health professional . Right now . ) " I 'll sell one-third of my beloved jazz records if I do n't  make the deadline , " is more realistic . <p> If you 're not willing or able to impose your own punishments , enlist someone else to help you . Make yourself accountable to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date and miss it , have that person come stand over you until you complete the punishment . Make them stand over you until you make the call to cancel that trip . Have them stand over you while you run those concert tickets through the shredder . Make them stand by while you tell those people who were counting on you that you wont be able to do whatever it was you promised you 'd do . Choose your person wisely . They have to be tough enough not to give in when you beg and pushy enough to make you do what you need to do . <p> Yes , this is a harsh way to improve productivity and make sure you reach your daily word count . Not everyone will respond to these tactics , but it is human nature to do those things with due dates first . This is simply a way of making human nature work for you . If you have trouble completing open-ended projects because they can always be done " later , " try imposing due dates and punishments on yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  work harder and smarter to avoid those punishments. <h> 1 comment <p> How exactly do you meet your writing deadlines ?

@@12747259 @1347259/ <h> Tag : essay word count <p> When it comes to writing essays , there are two frequent issues that arise ; the word count is either too low or too high for the stated range of the essay . For those who perpetually end up with too few words , you need to figure out ways to increase your essay word count . For those who frequently find themselves with too many words on the page , there are some simple steps to take when editing to help reduce the number of words while at the same time making it a stronger piece of writing . Below are some suggestions to do this . <h> Rank Your Arguments <p> If you find you 're well above your word count maximum , the first step is to rank the points you use to substantiate your argument . By ranking the importance of the arguments you make in the essay , you can eliminate ones which are n't  as important as others , keeping the essay strong while removing large portions of writing . If you do n't  want to eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count by mentioning all the arguments , but not writing as much detail about those not as strong as the more important points . <h> Focus on the Main Point <p> Once you determine what the important arguments are for your essay , read through it looking for any paragraphs or sentences which fail to address your main argument(s) or topic . Its easy to accidentally go off on tangents when writing , and eliminating these tangents can help reduce word count . The more focused you can remain on your topic and arguments , the more concise your writing will be . <h> Use the Best Verb <p> This may sound obvious , but a lot of writers do n't  do this well . When writing , always use the perfect verb rather than one that 's close , but not perfect . When you use the best verb possible , it will reduce the amount of writing you do in most cases . This is due to the fact that when you use a verb that 's not quite correct , you usually need to add more words to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the opposing team by a lot of points . " <p> While " beat " is accurate in this case , its not the perfect verb because they not only beat the team , they beat the team by a lot . Using the better verb " trounce " in this instant will reduce the word count while still giving the same meaning as the longer sentence . <p> " They trounced the opposing team . " <h> Remove Adverbs <p> Look through your essay and see if you find any adverbs , especially adverbs which have " ly " endings . In many instances , these adverbs end up being filler words which end up being placed in the writing because its the way we talk , but the words do n't  add anything beneficial to the actual essay . Go through the essay and ask if each one is needed and remove those that are n't  .

So Dr. Fry pushed Edward Dolch aside and created his Fry words . Fry words are basically a more modern version of the Dolch list . The first 100 words on the list are used so commonly that they make up 50 percent of all text . That means that 50 percent of everything that you read uses just these 100 words .

Sticking with research-based strategies is an intelligent thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by professionals . <p> It is important for someone learning the most commonly used words that a couple different strategies is used for both their reading and spelling . Of course we would use flash cards with sight words and incorporate them into activities , but we also need something more than that . Using a systematic and sequential phonics and decoding program would provide those learning English the skills needed to break apart letters and sounds . <h> Flash Cards <p> You do not want to take the first one hundred all at once and run through them as fast as you can with a person learning them for the first time . This will overwhelm them and make them feel inadequate . It will actually slow down the learning experience . Try working with only ten words at a time . Once they master those ten , move on to the next ten , but keep on incorporating the first ten words in as well . You can keep on doing this until you are all the way finished with Frys first one hundred words , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words a fun activity or game for the kid or struggling adult . You can use sight words in almost any game you can think of . You could provide a spinner and whatever number the person lands on , they then must correctly read that number of words . Using a timer is a fun way to learn as well for a kid . Check and see how fast they can go through all ten words correctly without missing any . If you are working with more than one struggling reader , then have them compete against one another . Flip over the word and whoever says it first will get the card . Competition is a good thing . It makes people strive to become better at something than they currently are . <h> Phonics and Decoding <p> Saying that someone needs a research-based systematic and sequential phonics and decoding program is quite a mouthful . Just hearing that might make someone run the other way . It sounds a bit scientific and difficult . However , those are million dollar words for quite an easy concept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A systematic and sequential phonics and decoding program just means that the lessons all proceed in a particular order .

They are shorter and will be easier to learn . After awhile , whoever is struggling will soon become a master ! <p> Think word count is n't important in writing ? Well , think again . As a writer , the number of words in a piece matters a great deal ; it is the only measure of productivity you have . Therefore , you need to ensure the number is within what 's expected for your genre and category . So how many words should your text have ? Let 's take a comprehensive look at word count list , and find out how it all works . <h> A good average sentence length <p> There 's no perfect length , however , a well-written sentence should have 15-20 words on average . Using simple and short sentences will help more people to understand your content . But restrain from using uniform sentence lengths if you do n't want your writings to be choppy and without flow . Though there 's the possibility of long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and readers may struggle to understand the whole content . People expect you to get to the point , especially your busiest readers . They do n't have the time to slow down to deconstruct the long , complicated sentences and contemplate the clauses . By making it simple , it shows you respect your content reader 's time and interest . <h> How many words in a paragraph ? <p> As you can expect , there is no fixed number of words that a paragraph should have . A rule of thumb : the paragraphs are usually about 100 to 200 words long , which is about 6-8 sentences . Nevertheless , it all depends on the ideas , and ideas come in many sizes . So the paragraph can be long enough to reach its end . But we ca n't ignore the fact that readers do n't like seeing blocks of paragraphs . And it 's for that reason you should stick to one concept or idea per paragraph to avoid creating very long paragraphs . Simply shift to a new paragraph when you shift to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A standard essay must be a minimum of 3-5 paragraphs , but if you 're not instructed to write the given paragraphs , there 's no point sticking to this extremely limiting rule . This is handy in academic writing , where your paragraphs are expected to be longer than most essays . On average , there are 100 to 200 words in a paragraph . And as a general rule with essays , you 'll have an introduction , body , and conclusion . So you can assume that a 1500-word essay will likely to have about 5-8 paragraphs . Remember your essay will be evaluated on the content you present , not the number of paragraphs . <h> How long should a book be ? <p> Though the length of your book is determined by the details needed to make it good , it is important to adhere to the expected word count in your genre and category . It demonstrates how well you understand your market . And in line with this , here are the industry norms worth knowing . <p> Under 500 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000-8,000 words <p> Novella Story : 10,000-40,000 words <h> Novel <p> A 40,000-word manuscript can be considered to be a novel , but to be eligible for finisher status , you 're required to write a minimum of 50,000 words . The maximum word is generally 60,000-100,000 words . <h> Sci-Fi and Fantasy Books <p> There is no rule on the word limit regarding science and fantasy fiction books . However , most of the books usually fall within the 90,000-120,000 words . The publisher and agents are more lenient on word limits for this genre ; therefore , you 're not likely to lose out on a deal if you exceeded the number of words . You may be wondering why the books in this category are an exception . Well , reading epic novels of this genre are interesting and require the audience to take some time to create the fantasy world around them , and then imagine themselves in it . <h> Adult Novels <p> The generally recommended words usually fall between 80,000 and 100,000 . If your manuscript is over 100,000 words , publishing it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word length for children novels is not set in stone , but even so , its likely to be around 20,000 to 40,000 words . <h> What is the average word count for an email ? <p> According to a study conducted by Email Labs , people spend about 15-20 seconds reading an email . Sending the readers lengthy email messages may make them feel overwhelmed , and might not read through it . Now , you may be tempted to ask , what 's the right number of words for an email ? Well , it all depends on the ideas or information you want to deliver . A rule of thumb : the shorter message , the better . Always try to limit your email to around 300 words or less . If your email message needs to be longer , it 's absolutely okay . However , focus on the main message , eliminate the distractions , and keep the content easy to scan . <h> How many words should your report have ? <p> There 's no set minimum or maximum , regardless of the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just assume the audience will take around 10-20 minutes reading the report . And on average , your readers can read 1 double-spaced page or 250 words in a minute . In 10 minutes they would have read about 2,500-4,500 words . But that 's just an approximation . Remember a few people read an entire report , so keep it simple and not too long . <h> How many words should your application have ? <p> Whether you are applying for a job or college , it 's extremely important to keep in mind that therell be a long list of applicants . When you present a very long resume , you 're simply scaring off the person wholl be reading it . Do n't  forget he/she has other applications to review . Even if you were to be more qualified , there 's a great possibility of wasting your chances . So if you are not instructed to write within a certain word limit , just make sure your application is short as possible , typically less than 500 words . <h> How long should your motivational letters be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation should n't be longer than one page . Make it around 300-500 words . It is crucial to keep it shorter , but make sure you highlight your most relevant qualifications and what you have to offer . <p> You 're writing your first novel , and you know you must shoot for around 80 to 95 thousand words . Once you know what your book will be about , its time to start planning the structure of the story . What will happen in each chapter , and how much has to happen before you move on to the next chapter ? How many chapters will you need before you reach your target word count ? <h> Its Up to You Within Reason <p> Before you decide your average chapter length , its a good idea to think about the purpose behind dividing a book into chapters . Think of it as a TV series or a play . Each chapter will consist of one or more scenes that contribute to the development of the story . <p> Unlike TV series , you are n't  limited to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer chapters . The important thing is to end each chapter at the end of a scene , allowing your reader to save the next " episode " for another time . <p> However , it does n't  make much sense to have one chapter that takes up a major part of the book while other chapters are much shorter . Admittedly , some published authors have done just that , but your readers may find it a little odd . <p> Your audience may also play a role . For example , books for the youth market often have shorter chapters than those intended for adult readers . Again , it is n't a rule , but if you 're writing for people with a short attention span , shorter chapters make sense . <h> How Long Are the Chapters in Books by Famous Authors ? <p> Looking at what successful authors have done in the past is always a help . That 's why writers should always be readers too . Best-selling books show us what the public likes , and of course , were hoping that our own novels will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter lengths , but remember that these are averages . In any of these books , some chapters are longer than others . <p> Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone has an average of 4,560 words per chapter . <p> Twilight uses about 4,580 words per chapter . <p> The Hunger Games uses 3,700-word chapters , dividing each chapter into three parts . <h> What Do Most Writers See as a Good Average Chapter Length ? <p> The debate is ongoing . Some will tell you 2,500 words is the average , while others will say that 3,000 to 5,000 word chapters are more likely to be the norm . Most agree that under 1,000 words would be rather short and that over 5,000 might be rather too long . As a general guideline , chapters should be between 3,000 to 5,000 words . <p> All of them agree that the chapter length should be defined by the story and that any chapter length targets you decide on are merely guidelines . Most of them say that trying to keep the chapters within a certain length range is helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are No Rules <p> Writers sometimes use extra-short chapters such as ones that are a sentence or two long for emphasis . The element of surprise at finding a chapter that consists of a sentence , or even just a word , will make readers sit up and take note . However , use this technique sparingly . It loses its effect if you regularly do it . <p> There 's also no real rule that says a chapter ca n't be longer than 5,000 words . Daniel Defoe wrote the book Moll Flanders without dividing it into chapters at all , so in theory , you could say that the entire book consisted of just one chapter . However , as a new author , I 'm not sure you would get away with that . <h> Its the Story That Matters Most <p> Trying to pad out an uneventful chapter with thoughts or events that do n't  contribute to your plot will bore your readers leaving them with the impression you 're waffling . Compressing a very exciting scene so you can meet your chapter word count target is also not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chapters in the 3,000 to 5,000-word range is a good guideline when roughing out your books structure , it is n't a rule , and the story itself should be the primary deciding factor . Build your plot through a series of events or scenes . Then decide for yourself where the chapter divisions will be . You may decide to include two or more scenes in a chapter , or you might stick to one scene per chapter . Just ensure that the division comes at a time when a reader could put the book down if they want a break . Of course , if you keep it exciting enough , your reader will want to know what will happen next , and might have trouble putting the book down at all . <p> No , were not talking about " homework , " " responsibility " or anything else that implies you 'll have to make an enormous effort when youd rather be doing something else . Instead , were talking about words that give you a feeling of real disgust . They 're perfectly ordinary , **27;975;TOOLONG words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rate words based on their gut-reaction , these words are consistently rated as being the most hated ones . <h> A Lot of People Hate the Word " Moist " <p> Paul Thibodeau , a psychology professor , authored a study based on the way 2,500 people reacted to words , and " moist " was generally considered to be downright nasty . Its possible the reaction would have been different if he included it in a phrase like " moist chocolate cake , " but when viewed on its own , it was seen as being absolutely disgusting by 25 percent of the group . <p> Words using similar sounds did n't  get the thumbs down . People felt relatively neutral about " hoist , " for example . So , what 's the problem with " moist ? " <p> Professor Thibodeau thinks it may be the association between " moist " and bodily functions . " Vomit " and " phlegm " were also rated as being among the most-hated , so he joined the dots and decided that words related to bodily fluids were the pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Professor Jason Riggle and Dr. David Eagleman , a neuroscientist , think that word aversion comes from the sounds themselves . Just as we feel odd after hearing a jarring sound in music , certain word-sounds are unpleasant to us . Dr. Eagleman has done his own experiments using made-up words and found that people did n't  like unusual sound combinations . So , if we think a word sounds funny , were more likely to associate it with something unpleasant . <h> Associations or Sounds : Who Is Right ? <p> I 'm going to sit on the fence with this one . Associations really can make a word disgusting . Take " vomit " for example . The very thought of vomiting is stomach-churning . The word itself is probably innocent enough , but the association is utterly gross ! <p> At the same time , I can believe that sounds that do n't  fit our ideas of harmony would also be jarring . Unlike Dr. Eagleman , I 've never invented a truly disgusting word , and I would n't know where to begin , but it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being disgusted by words are valid . What do you think ? <h> Is This Useful Knowledge ? <p> Oddly enough , I think this knowledge could be useful , particularly in the marketing world . When we send out marketing messages , we need to be very careful in our word choices . We might even want to disgust our audience before offering them a calming , soothing message that explains how to solve a problem . Alternatively , we might want to avoid any negative associations whatsoever . <p> Still , just because of chocolate cake , I 'm not altogether convinced about the gut-churning effects of the word " moist . " Couple it with cake , and suddenly , it sounds very , very yummy . Is it just me who thinks so ? Of course , being covered with moist sweat sounds a whole lot less delicious , so I think we need to add context before we can talk about word aversion . <p> Made-up words are two-a-penny . Just look at company names and brand names , and you 're sure to find at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds or combinations of sounds give people that " Eeeyew ! " feeling of disgust , and which ones make them feel great , it could surely help companies with their branding strategies . <h> Is It OK to Hate Words ? <p> Ive read commentary about how silly it is to hate words , but whether its silly or not , it seems to be a real enough phenomenon . But to play devils advocate , we need negative words as much as we need positive ones . After all , if you want to describe something gross , having some unpleasant-sounding words or ones with less-than-charming associations , is mighty handy ! <p> I use " vomit " quite often , " I went into the exam room , vomited out a whole lot of information , and scored an A ! " The word " regurgitated " is interchangeable here , or you could use it to indicate your disgust , " He just regurgitated the same old information we always hear on that subject ! " <p> Of course , some people react more strongly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to sensitivity or possibly a very active imagination . Neither of these things is bad to have , although they might make your life a little more interesting than it needs to be . <h> What Words Do You Hate and Why ? <p> First , a few ground-rules . Well just assume that anything obscene or scatological is gross , so those words are out of bounds . Some words are annoying , but that 's because of the way people use them and abuse them , so well overlook them too . What we want , is a list of words that make you feel slightly queasy just looking at them . <p> here 's my two cents worth : <p> Blog . I do n't  know why I hate it so much . I think its the sound of the word . And looking around the web , I see that others agree with me . <p> Mucus . This seems to confirm the theory that bodily fluids disgust us . But somehow , even " snot " is better than " mucus , " so maybe its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuk ! I cant think of a good thing to say about this word . Nothing about it is nice ! <p> Maggot . The word itself may not be to blame , but the associations are there ! <p> To be honest , I do n't  think there are any words that I hate in the truest sense of the word , but these would certainly top my list of the words I do n't  like all that much . <h> Top Words People Hate <p> For those looking for a top list of words people hate , here are some words to consider : <p> Love has been described as " A Many Splendored Thing " in poems ( William Waterway ) , in films ( 1955 ) , and in Academy Award winning songs ( lyrics Paul Francis Webster ) . The same descriptive phrase has been used for a TV soap opera . <p> " A Many Splendored Thing " originated in a poem by late 19th century poet , Francis Thompson . He was English , so he probably included a " u " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hound of Heaven as he spent 182 lines investigating Christianity and Gods search for a missing soul . This would , of course , be 182 lines of words describing the concept of divine love . However , the phrase that has outlived him is n't really a conclusive description . Its rather a cop-out . <p> In the 1970 movie " Love Story " Erich Segal used the phrase " Love means never having to say you 're sorry , " and at about the same time in our history of kitschy-coo , notebooks and stickers flooded the market featuring drawn outlines of a girl and boy , and sugar sweet " Love Is " statements . <h> The Search for the Best Words for Love <p> People have been looking for the best words to describe love for years , centuries , and perhaps for millennia . Perhaps they have been searching since the days when cavemen began grabbing cavewomen by the hair before dragging them into the cave as a mark of affection . It would have made sense for them to start considering something other than grunts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair could be hard work , and grunts could be misunderstood . A cliche or two could save a lot of effort . <p> Fairy tales , poets , Hollywood movies and Internet sites followed centuries later , finding thousands , if not tens of thousands of ways to continue the quest for the best words to describe love . The very fact they kept coming up with new ones indicates its not easy and the best , and most conclusive , description has not yet been found . <h> What Is Love ? <p> Anyone who can come up with a definitive answer will have discovered something important . It might have more impact than any other scientific discoveries which have earned experts Nobel Prizes over the years . This could happen because it would influence peoples everyday lives and relationships in a way that could change the world . At least then people might have a real reference point when trying to explain love . <p> As the situation stands now , there are no words , best or otherwise , that will describe love in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will give everyone a lightbulb moment and a reason to respond , " That 's it ! Now I know what love is . Now I can love , be loved and , maybe , be in love . " <h> Parts of Many Speeches <p> Its no wonder its so difficult . The word " love " forms parts of many types of speech . It can be a noun ( or naming word ) for a series of sensations , feelings and emotions . It is also a verb or " doing or action word " when it comes to experiencing it . In addition , love also functions as a noun modifier in " love affair , " an adjective in " loving relationship " and an adverb in " He looked at her lovingly . " <p> Further complicating the idea of describing love in words is the fact that there are so many different types of love . As if it is n't already impossible to describe the love experience in words , we are expected to find more words , more adjectives , adverbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will break it down into categories that are more specific , but probably even harder to describe . <h> Adding to the Confusion <p> As a result , the following words , and more , are tossed in : unconditional and conditional , free , passionate , romantic , selfless and self , playful , divine , maternal and paternal , brotherly and sisterly , eternal and endless . Its supposed to help if we add these to the word we find hardest to apply , and almost impossible to describe . Its meant to make the unmeasurable more manageable by separating it into smaller categories . <p> The effect it has , however , is to set up a lot more puzzles and challenges . Now we have not only one concept to describe , and to understand , but several . Perhaps once we have come up with the best words to describe unconditional , or even maternal love , we can return to describing romantic love . Then we can hopefully , get closer to understanding the wonderful , scary , passionate and all-consuming experience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many splendored thing " but its also sometimes a many pitfalled thing . It can make you the happiest person around , particularly if you experience it as a verb of doing and experiencing . It can also break your heart if you keep falling in and out of the love noun . <h> Words that Describe Love <p> For those who are simply looking for a list of words that describe love , or make reference to it , here are some of the most popular : <p> There seems to be a day for just about everything . I would n't be in the least bit surprised if I came across National Let 's Eat Takeout Day , and I 'd probably support it if it existed . Earth Day is real enough , but why only one day ? Shouldnt we make every day Earth Day ? Maybe we would n't want to turn off the lights for an hour every night , but perhaps we could turn off the TV , or do something else that 's good for the environment . <p> Now we have National Word Day . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know ! <h> Why National Word Day ? <p> Have you ever noticed we do n't  use a lot of the words in our vocabulary ? By the time you reach the age of four , you already know 10,000 words . Once you reach adulthood , you 'll probably know 20,000 to 35,000 different words , and you 'll keep learning new ones until you reach middle age ( and possibly even later if you have a curious mind and like to read ) . <p> How many of the words you know do you use in everyday speech ? I could n't find an answer to this question , but I 'm ready to guess we probably use the same 10,000 we knew when we were little , if we even use that many . <p> There are currently 171,476 words in the English language , with more being added every day . I know because I counted them especially for you . Alright , I did n't  . I looked that up . <p> According to the same source , a further 47,156 words have become obsolete or archaic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they became extinct . When we stop using words , they just die out of the language , and you have to admit that the mass-extinction of words is rather a sad thing . <p> That 's why we have National Word Day . Its a words-conservation drive ! <h> What Should You Do on National Word Day ? <p> We are encouraged to give seldom-used words an airing in the hope that others will pick them up and use them too . National Word Day is a celebration of language . We are encouraged to take the words we use in conversation to the next level , making our speech much more colorful , individual and interesting . <p> If we are able , we are asked to actually immortalize a word . Is it possible ? Yes , it is ! Well see how a little further on . <p> Last , but not least , were asked to read the dictionary until we find a word we did n't  know . We must then memorize that word and immediately put it to use in our speech and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In celebration of a poet and playwright who has kept many words that would otherwise have become obsolete alive , National Word Day is celebrated on the Ides of March . That 's the 15th of March , the day when Caesar is believed to have been assassinated . This day was immortalized by Shakespeare , keeping the word " Ides " alive , even though its usually only used when we read Shakespeares play . <p> On the Ides of March , you get your chance to make a seldom-used word or words immortal . Start thinking which ones you will choose ! I think I will go for " rabelaisian , " a word I so seldom use that I had forgotten how to spell it and had to look it up . I like it because it rolls off the tongue nicely , and because it refers to bold , coarse , robust humor which I generally keep out of this blog , but I still enjoy . I would be quite sad if that word died out . <h> Who Started National Word Day ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got it off to a good start with this blog post . Who gave me the right to do this ? Well , its a free country is n't it ? You do n't  think I have enough credibility to start a special day all on my own ? I probably do n't  , but you 're going to help me , are n't  you ? What 's in it for you ? Absolutely nothing ! I wont even promise you my eternal gratitude for your contribution . <p> Look at it this way : if one person celebrates National Word Day , people will think they 're crazy . If two people celebrate it , people will think its a conspiracy , but if you can get three people celebrating the day , people might just think its a movement , and join in . Well , that 's my theory anyway . <p> Whos up for joining me in the celebration ? Youd better start preparing now . Its like Christmas shopping . If you wait too long , all the best words will be taken . Which one will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to invite your friends ! <p> This seemingly idle question may not be all that simple to answer . One thing is sure , 1,000 words all written without any paragraph spacing will drive your reader a little mad . The first point is clear : 1,000 words is a lot of words . Split it up into paragraphs for heavens sake , or expect your intended readers to head for the hills for a chance to rest their weary eyes on some open space . <p> So given you need to transform your 1,000 words into something easy on the eyes , you know you have to split it into paragraphs . How do you do that ? <h> A Sentence Is an Idea , a Paragraph Is Closely Related Ideas <p> Whatever you 're discussing , you 'll discover a number of concepts which you presumably planned before you started writing . To make it all hang together nicely , you add a bit of space when you transition from one area of discussion to another . As with any rule , there are exceptions , but broadly speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100-200 word range . <p> Bear in mind that academic and essay writing usually means you 're writing for a fairly dedicated reader , but what about the huge chunk of the population who are frightened off by big chunks of text , even if they are only six or seven lines long ( depending on font ) ? <h> Journalists and Commercial Writers Keep Their Paragraphs Short <p> " White space " is a wonderful illusion that tells your reader what you have to say is pretty easy to take in . I 've seen some news articles in which each paragraph is only one sentence long . I feel that 's taking it to extremes , and it can have the opposite effect of making your writing look disjointed . I like to see at least three or four lines to a paragraph , and as an indication , my longest paragraph so far is just 74 words long . <p> You can assume commercial writing and news reports will have paragraphs approximately half as long as the ones youd see in academic or essay writing . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words instead of five to ten . <h> Dialogues Have a New Paragraph for Every New Speaker <p> One context in which a paragraph can be as short as five characters is direct speech involving two or more speakers . <p> " Oh ! " <p> Count em : two characters for the word , and three for the punctuation marks . To begin with , youd introduce or refer to your speakers , but once the conversation is flowing nicely , you can start skipping them at times . <p> " No ! " exclaimed Mary . <p> " Yes ! " John couldnt help being amused at Marys surprise . <p> " You do n't  really mean it , do you ? " <p> " Of course I mean it , silly ! " <p> Its a lot less cumbersome to skip a mention of the speaker than to add " said Mary " and " John said " after every direct quote . So theoretically , you can have a paragraph consisting of one word plus punctuation marks . 1,000 words in direct speech would therefore mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our initial guideline suggested . <h> How Many Paragraphs in 1,000 Words ? <p> here 's a basic summary . <p> Probably not less than 5 paragraphs . <p> For easy reading , probably no less than 10 . <p> For direct speech , one for every time you change speaker ( however many times that is ) . <h> Does It Matter ? <p> Not necessarily , but bear in mind that even teachers who are paid to read students writing get tired eyes . The easier it is to read and understand what you have written , the more likely your teacher is to notice those clever details you included . There 's also a distinct possibility they wont start hating you while they read your work . Yes , they 're supposed to be unbiased , but everyone is human ! <p> When writing in other contexts : an article , a blog , or a book , keeping paragraphs short helps to hold your readers attention . Yes , there are famous writers who just wrote without much attention to paragraphs , or even punctuation , but their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be , " easy " is invariably the preferred option . <p> To take easy reading to the next level , try using sub-headers every paragraph to three paragraphs . This is applicable to blogs and web pages , and to a certain extent , in academic writing . When you hit a web page for info , what do you do ? I look at the header , and then I scan the sub-heads to get an idea of the writers approach to the subject . If it looks like fluff , I kill the page and move on . But if the sub-headers are interesting , and seem to tell me there 's something worth learning , I 'll read the whole piece . <h> Whatever You Do , Use Paragraphs <p> Using paragraphs well ( with or without sub-heads ) makes your work more accessible to your reader , and , to a certain extent , it shows you 've ordered your thoughts and are discussing one point at a time . If you cant organize your work into paragraphs consisting of related thoughts , you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <h> How Many Paragraphs is <p> The following list is an approximation for those who are writing essays with the standard 100 200 words per paragraph and 50 to 100 words for blog or article easy reading . The actual number of paragraphs will depend on numerous factors and this is nothing more than a general rough estimate . Below are estimated words to paragraphs conversions : <p> 250 words is 1 to 3 paragraphs for essays , 3 to 5 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 500 words is 3 to 5 paragraphs for essays , 5 to 10 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 750 words is 4 to 8 paragraphs for essays , 8 to 15 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1000 words is 5 to 10 paragraphs for essays , 10 to 20 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 1500 words is 8 to 15 paragraphs for essays , 15 to 30 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2000 words is 10 to 20 paragraphs for essays , 20 to 40 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 2500 words is 13 to 25 paragraphs for essays , 25 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 paragraphs for essays , 30 to 60 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 4000 words is 20 to 40 paragraphs for essays , 40 to 80 paragraphs for easy writing <p> 5000 words is 25 to 50 paragraphs for essays , 50 to 100 paragraphs for easy writing <p> Symbolism is all around us , and although some symbols are universal , some concepts have symbolic significance that are purely individual . As I 'm sure you 've guessed , words are made up of symbols ( the alphabet ) , but words also have a deep symbolic significance in themselves . Even your name is symbol that represents your identity ! <p> Words can be symbols all on their own , or they can be combined to create symbolism . So how are words used as symbols ? Here are some examples of specific words as symbols <h> Colors <p> Colors , and the words we use to define them are highly symbolic . <p> " He wore purple . " Purple is associated with royalty and has been since Roman times . Originally , this happened because purple dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In those days , the really wealthy people were aristocrats or monarchs , hence the symbolism of purple for royalty which we still use today . <p> " She was in a black mood . " Black has many symbolic connections . It could represent grief , but in this context it represents anger and negativity . Its rather unfair because black is a perfectly lovely color , but there it is ! <p> " Her intentions were white as the driven snow . " White symbolizes purity . I can vouch for it because whenever I wear white , it gets dirty fast ! <p> " When he started to act up , I just saw red ! " Here , red symbolizes anger , but it can also symbolize danger . For example , " When he behaved so badly , it was a big red flag for me . " <h> Miscellaneous Examples <p> Our ability to equate words with associations has led to everything from flowers to times of the day and directions being used as symbols . <p> " She chose the left-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , " sinister " even meant " left " at one time . A person who is interested in the left-hand path is into the occult . As a left-hander , I take exception to that . <p> " It was a downward spiral . " To us , " downward " symbolizes something that is not going well . Personally , I love going downhill , especially on a bicycle , but in other contexts the connotation is less positive . <p> " Who said life was going to be all roses ? " In this example , roses refer to easy living with everything being beautiful and positive . But as we know , every rose has a thorn . <p> " Its your baby ! " A baby symbolizes responsibility , and no wonder ! But it also symbolizes immaturity , helplessness or weakness . For example , " Do n't  be a baby ! " <p> " It was the dawn of a new era , " or " It suddenly dawned on me ! " Dawn or sunrise represent something new . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " Just as dawn symbolizes a fresh start , twilight symbolizes a period when things come to an end . <p> " Alcohol was his crutch . " A crutch helps us along , but it also symbolizes other ways to get by . <p> These forms of symbolism are so universal among English speakers that few people even think of the reasons for the symbolism behind them . <h> Are All Words Symbols ? <p> " Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us ; nowhere do they touch on absolute truth " ( Nietzsche ) <p> Its time to open your mind . Although we 've looked at words being used symbolically , Nietzsche contended that all words are symbols , and if you think about it , he was absolutely right ! A word is just a collection of syllables , but when we hear it , all sorts of ideas and associations come flooding into our minds . <p> These can be quite subjective . For instance , the word " lavender " could make you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly people , your mothers garden , or perhaps a friend . It all depends on the personal associations or symbolism the word has to you . No wonder communication is such a minefield . <p> Have you ever found yourself arguing with someone who is basically agreeing with you in different words ? That 's because your frame of reference is different . The words you used do n't  have the same associations or symbolism for the other person as they do for you . <p> Words are symbols for thoughts , and no matter what language you speak , you use them according to the thoughts you associate with those words . For example , if you had a happy childhood , the word " mother " brings along all kinds of positive associations , but for some- people , it just cant have the same effect , even when they understand the broader cultural context . <p> It would be impossible to show you an example of the way we use all words as symbols other than to say this entire article is a combination of symbols intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared context , the English language , most of the words mean similar things to all of us , but if your context differs from mine , you may have trouble understanding what I 'm trying to say . <h> Words Are Used Symbolically and All Words Are Symbols <p> So now you know . If you thought words were just words , think again . We may share a mutual understanding of words , or we may fail to understand one another because the symbols ( words ) mean different things to us based on our life experiences or frame of reference . <p> Although there are many opinions on how many types of essays there are , everyone seems to agree on what you need to formulate a good paragraph . You 'll probably have read that a sentence expresses a single idea . A paragraph is a group of sentences dealing with a similar idea . As soon as you move on to a new set of ideas , you move on to a new paragraph . <p> When you create an essay outline , you will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're thinking clearly , each of these ideas would have a paragraph to itself . If some of the ideas you jotted down are closely related , theyd probably form part of the same paragraph . <h> Crafting a Paragraph <p> In a way , you could see each paragraph as a mini-essay . <p> You introduce the topic <p> You provide the contributing information <p> You draw a conclusion <p> But how do you know if you have crafted a good paragraph ? It will have four characteristics : <p> Unity <p> Order <p> Coherence <p> Completeness <p> You achieve these four characteristics through using the three parts of your paragraph wisely and with forethought . <h> First Sentence <p> The first sentence in a paragraph is important , and its called the " topic sentence . " It should represent the overall idea that governs the rest of the paragraphs content . Its the sames as your essay introduction leads into your essay . All the sentences that follow will contribute to this topic sentence . For example , in this paragraph , I began by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I am telling you what it is for , and how it relates to the other sentences in the paragraph . If you do this well , you 'll achieve the first of our characteristics : unity . <h> Contributing Sentences <p> Your contributing sentences must lead logically to the concluding one . This means you need to present it in some kind of order . Will you choose chronological order , order of importance , or relate each successive sentence to the other using logic ? That depends on what you are writing about , but your aim is to make your paragraph easy to follow from point A to point B to point C. Finally , you want to tie all your points together to underline the point you are trying to get across . Order helps to convey the sense of what you are saying . If you confuse your reader , you have not written a clever paragraph . <h> Order Should Bring Coherence <p> Have you ever listened to someone talking , and it sounds like they 're just babbling and not making any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherently , each thought follows neatly from the previous one , and it is easy to understand what they are saying . Although its not a must , using transition words helps to show how one thought relates to another . There are many such words and phrases which include : <p> Because <p> In addition <p> By contrast <p> Next <p> Afterward <p> Accordingly <p> No doubt <p> Of course <p> On the other hand <p> Naturally <p> Also <p> After <p> Before <p> Another important trick to remember is to keep all your sentences in the same verb tense . It just makes it so much easier for your reader to follow your thoughts . <h> Your Concluding Sentence <p> Do n't  leave your reader wondering " So what ? " at the end of your paragraph . Pull your threads together into a concluding sentence . It should support your introductory sentence while acknowledging what you have discussed in the supporting sentences . This helps your reader to see how the supporting information relates to the topic . You may think it is obvious , but your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good paragraph is something of an art , but like any skill , you can learn it through practice . That 's why teachers will set paragraph writing tasks for their students . But if you love writing , or just want to improve your writing skills , there 's no reason why you should n't set yourself a few tasks . Choose from a list of paragraph writing prompts , or make up a list of your own . <p> Here are some ideas : <p> Why I enjoy my hobby so much <p> My favorite winter activity <p> My opinion on ( Choose anything you like ) <p> Why I hope to become a <p> I think the most important thing about a person is <p> Why I admire my best friend <p> My favorite season is <p> My most embarrassing moment was when <p> The thing I 'm most scared of <p> What I dreamed last night <p> Remember , keep it to one paragraph ! After you 've written it , leave it for a while because its hard to evaluate your own work right away . Later , go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my opening sentence ? <p> Do my other points support it ? <p> Did I reach a conclusion , and does it match the opening sentence and the supporting ones ? <p> Have I presented my information in a logical way ? Could I have done it better ? <p> Writing a paragraph is n't all that difficult , but you cant just run at it like a bull at a gate . If you think things through , you 'll find yourself naturally falling in with the rules we 've discussed here . Thoughtful work is usually good work , so engage your grey matter and get writing ! <p> To succeed at school , you need to be able to write different types of essays . Your teachers will seldom tell you exactly which type of essay you should be writing , so you need to be able to figure it out from the question you have been asked . Once you 've identified the right type of essay to answer the question , you 're not home free yet , but at least you 'll know how to structure it and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions on how to categorize essays and how many types of essay there are . The simplest interpretation says that there are only four types of essays : <p> I personally think this is a bit of an oversimplification . I also think there are overly complicated classifications of essays , so to keep things relatively simple , well stick to 10 types . Feel free to disagree with me if you like ! <h> Descriptive Essays <p> In this type of essay , you 're painting a word picture . You can certainly include some facts , but you 'll focus on the experience , what it feels like , looks like , smells or sounds like . Your aim is to draw the reader in so he or she can experience what you are writing about in the same way you experienced it . <h> Definition Essays <p> A definition tells you what something is . Although a definition is short , a definition essay discusses a complex concept in much greater depth than you would get from a few lines . Theyre most often used to discuss philosophical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given two similar-seeming yet different things to compare . To write this essay , I suggest that you prepare carefully . Which elements are the same ? Which ones are different ? Once you are sure you know what information you want to include , you 're ready to go . <h> Cause and Effect Essays <p> Although the name seems self-explanatory , we need to remember several causes can contribute to a single effect , and conversely , one cause could result in several effects . For example , several factors contributed to the US involvement in the First World War ( multiple causes , single effect ) . However , being in the war had several effects on the US ( single cause multiple effects ) . <h> Narrative Essays <p> If you like creative writing , these will be among your favorite essays . In a narrative essay , you tell a story . Remember , it has a beginning followed by a number of events that lead up to an ending . Plan carefully ! <h> Process Essays <p> This type of essay involves a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting your steps in the correct order is important if you do n't  want to turn your process into a muddle . Write your process essay in chronological order . <h> Argumentative Essays <p> Are you opinionated ? Good ! The argumentative essay explains your opinions and the reasons why you believe they 're right . You can even look at some possible counter-arguments and why you believe they 're wrong . Ultimately , you 're trying to get your reader to agree with you , so the more facts you can present to support your points , the better . <h> Critical Essays <p> You do n't  have to criticize the thing you 're writing about unless you think there is reason for it , but you 'll be evaluating it critically . You 'll provide reasons why you think something was well done or badly done . If you think it was great , why did you think so ? Are there any faults that bothered you ? Why did they bother you ? What evidence can you present to support your opinion ? <h> Expository Essay <p> You could sum this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , and then interpret them ! " You must reach a conclusion , and this has to be supported by your research or personal experience . In higher education , you have to show your ability to research your topic , and youll probably be citing experts along the way . In the end , you give your own opinion , but you 'll point out how several sources contribute to it . As long as there is logic in that , your answer ca n't be wrong . These essays are exciting because even when you use existing knowledge , you may find yourself obtaining a new perspective or reaching a novel conclusion . <h> Persuasive Essays <p> In a way , these are similar to argumentative essays , but they 're not quite the same . An argumentative essay will hit people with the facts , while a persuasive essay has a softer touch and may appeal to moral values or emotions . See it as the difference between winning a debate and winning someone over to support a cause . There are differences , but also similarities . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an instruction or exam question , study the VERBS your teacher has used . Circle them and think about what they imply . If you 've just been told to name or list things , give nothing but the facts . <p> Other words indicating that you should usually give nothing but the facts : <p> Analyze <p> Explain <p> Illustrate <p> Prove <p> Show <p> Compare <p> Contrast <p> Discuss <p> In addition , you want to look for words indicating that you should give your opinion : <p> In your opinion <p> What do you think about <p> How do you feel <p> If you have any doubt about the type of essay you should be writing , ask . While your teacher likely wont tell you when assigning , she will explain the correct type of essay to write for the particular situation and how you can figure that out . This should prove beneficial so you can deduct the correct type to write in future situations .

Why not go with what works for everyone , and use the most popular words found in hit songs ? If you 're wondering whether there actually are words that songwriters continually resort to , it wo n't take you long to hit on the word " love . " I have no idea how many songs contain that word , but I 'm ready to bet they number in the tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , or even millions ! <p> ALRIGHT ALREADY ! Ill stop ! Please do n't  hit me over the head again ! I thought it was an absolutely brilliant lyric My artistic sensibilities are wounded , I tell you . Wounded ! <h> In the Interests of Linguistics , Science and Music <p> Owing to the stiff critique my first ever song lyric faced , I decided to look for other words that are popular in songs . If I can find enough , I can make a song generator . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , list of third lines join the dots between them and combine them anyhow you like , and voila ! One perfect song lyric . And in case you 're wondering , Ive seen it done , and it works ! <p> Before we can start generating phrases , we need the words . The first thing you 'll likely notice is popular words in songs tend to be short . You are n't  going to find a lot of Shakespeare in most popular song lyrics . You 'll also find words are rather genre specific . For instance , " dark , black , bloody , thunder , fire , ice , and angels " all sound like they fit into gothic or metal genres , but well take a broader overview . <p> Yeah ( Now there 's a great word !

If you do n't  know the meaning of this word , youd better learn it now . As you can tell , the prefix " post " means " after " and that 's followed by " truth " so this literally means " after the truth . " <p> However , as far as I can see , it has n't  got anything to do with what comes after the truth . Rather , it relates to something that happens completely outside of the truth , or at least is assumed based on flimsy evidence . It means thinking with your emotions and how you feel about things , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend these days , so switch off your smarts and go with your gut . Woohoo ! Suddenly , we all become geniuses ! <h> Other Brand-New Top 2016 Words <p> Brexit . No list of 2016s new words would be complete without Brexit . Initially coined to describe the UKs exit from the European Union , it has now come to mean anything that 's anti-globalization . Its also seen as implying passionate nationalism . I suspect that several other words will be coined to follow it , and well go into those a little later . <p> Trumpism . As you can tell , 2016 was a year for politics with the gloves off . Its been such a weird year that we 've had to create- new words to describe some of the new phenomena . Trump , love him or hate him , has certainly come up with a new post-truth style , and the utterances that arise from this have become known as " Trumpisms " this year . <p> Sharenting . Luckily , it has n't  all been politics . We still have social media for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " moments . Go ahead , show your sharenting skills and post that pic . After all , I post pics of my kittens , and we can have some blissful relief from political discussion by entering an argument about which is cuter : your baby or my kittens ! <p> Uberization . Wow ! Guess what ? Spell check already recognizes this one . As you may have guessed , Uberization relates to the so-called " sharing economy " in which service providers offer services directly to prospective clients for less than theyd pay if they went through a company . <h> Existing ( and slightly altered ) Words Everyones Googling <p> Merriman-Webster lists these words as having been wildly popular in 2016 . <p> Surreal : " marked by the intense irrationality of a dream . " I kid you not , it has been a strange year , and the popularity of this word is a symptom of that . <p> Revenant : " one that returns after death or a long absence . " I like this word a lot , and we have Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyones radar . <p> Icon : " a person who is very successful or admired . " Sigh . A lot of icons have died this year , and the headlines probably contained the word , leading folks to look it up for interests sake . <p> Bigly : Heres a fun one . Did you know that Trump never actually said " bigly ? " That 's what linguists are saying . Apparently , they have done voice analyses and report that Trump actually said " big league . " Who cares ? We heard " bigly ! " We like it ! <p> Irregardless : Merriam-Webster says that technically , " irregardless " is a word . However , it says that the word , which sparked a lexical storm after a commentator at the World Series final used it , is " non-standard . " Its nice that we can still get excited over trivia ! <h> What Will Be the Top Words for 2017 ? <p> I 'm going to TRY to stay clear of the political minefield in my predictions . Am I cowardly ? Yup ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings are running rather high at the moment . There 's just one political word prediction from me , and that 's " Nexit . " <p> What does Nexit mean ? Whoevers next to exit the EU , of course ! It could be a Frexit , or a Grexit , or a Dexit , or we could segue into a Swexit , but unless the UK ends up having a really , really hard time as a result of its decision , someones going to follow suit . Any bets ? <p> I can already see some words starting to trend , but I 'm afraid they 're political too . <p> Fascism and all its permutations seems incredibly popular at the moment . I do n't  think most people know what it really means , so I imagine there will be plenty of furtive googling so nobody has to actually ask . And no , this is not political commentary , merely an observation . <p> Apartheid is also doing the rounds once again . In case you did n't  know , this was the old South African policy of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but once again , I see it gaining new popularity on social media right now . <p> Trump is going to gain a whole new meaning in 2017 . What will that be ? Time will tell . I suspect it wo n't have anything to do with a game of cards . <p> Then I suppose I should be a little creative too : <p> Phews is my own creation . It describes the phenomenon of fake news . Its a hybrid between " fake " and " news " with the " ph " to make it trendy . Its genius , really . Help me to make it go viral ! <p> Twentysixteen could catch on as a word to describe something that youd like to leave behind . Personally , I have no real problem with the year , but I think a slightly less exciting one would be nice for a change . <p> Post-politics will be way better than post-truth . I would suggest this word should mean getting on with ones life while ignoring politicians as much as possible . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only problem with that is that one does have to watch them , if only out of the corner of your eye . <p> I 'll enjoy revisiting my list at the end of 2017 when were ready to enter into 2018 . To be honest , I look back fondly to the time when " selfie " was the number one word of the year . At the time , I thought it a warning symptom of a culture of narcissism , but compared to 2016s words , it was positively cheerful !

@@12747263 @1347263/ <h> Creative Ways to Develop Your Novel Character <p> One of the hardest things about writing fiction is creating characters that are believable . Too many writers create characters that are just like themselves . While this seems like a way of " writing what you know , " too often it ends up creating a " Mary Sue " character . Mary Sues come across as poorly developed , shallow reflections of the author , not fully developed characters in their own right . <p> So how to create a character that is believable if the character is nothing like you and shares nothing of your experience ? How do you create , for example , an accountant with five kids if you flunked basic math and hate kids ? If you want to create good writing , the keys are research , observation , and personal experience . There are several ways to go about gathering the information needed to create a well-rounded , believable character . Here are some ideas . <h> Library , archive , and online research <p> If you 're trying to learn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , occupations , etc. ) , medical condition , or location , simple research is the best place to start . And do n't  just settle for a quick Google search . Spend some time looking at relevant documents/exhibits and immersing yourself in the information . Your character would be living this life , so do n't  treat it lightly . <h> Shadow someone else <p> If you 're trying to craft an unfamiliar life , try to find someone who lives that life and shadow them . Writing about an investment banker ? See if you can find one who will let you follow them for a day . Writing about a single mother who goes to night school ? See if someone you know fits that description and will let you ride along for a day or two . <h> Work their job <p> See if you can do the actual work that your characters will be doing . Some jobs may be closed to you , but you may have some success getting close enough if you offer to volunteer . If your character is a rancher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few days . Or see if you can volunteer in a classroom to get closer to being a teacher . Volunteering in a hospital may get you close enough to the medical profession that you can create a believable doctor , even if you ca n't be one yourself . <h> Interviews <p> Let 's say you need to understand how a serial killer works . Chances are , you 're not going to go to interview one . ( You might , but probably not . And youd better not become one . ) What can you do ? Interview people who work with/around serial killers . See if you can speak to a psychiatrist , cop , or coroner to get an idea of the motivations , methods , etc. of a serial killer . Its always best if you can interview someone directly about their job or life but if you cant , think of a way around that limitation . Speak to people who work with or around the subject you need to know about . <h> Visit their location <p> If your characters are living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll get a better sense of the place , people , and opportunities/lifestyles if you go there rather than just relying on travel guides . Location visits are also useful for battlefields and historical settings , as well . <h> People watch <p> Watching people is one of the best ways to learn about them . Figure out where your character would go ( for work , leisure , living , etc. ) and go there yourself . Spend some time watching how to the people act , interact , and speak . What do they do ? Where do they go ? What do they talk about ? What are they wearing ? <h> Create a character profile <p> Spend some time filling in all the details you can about this person , even if those details wont make it into the book . Appearance , age , medical history , traits , quirks , politics , religion , background , genealogy , education , relationships , life experiences , career , childhood experiences , residences , travels , and more are all things you should know . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will seem and the better able you 'll be to determine how shed deal with the situations in your story . If you really want your character to come to life , consider giving him or her 10 traits that you never plan to reveal directly to the reader . These will come through in your writing even though you do n't  directly share the details with the reader giving the character more richness . <h> Figure out what they want <p> Characters , just like real people , are driven by a variety of needs and forces . Youll have to figure out what they want to gain from the story as a whole ( win the war , secure the romantic relationship , kill the bad guy , etc. ) as well as what they hope to achieve at each decision and action point within the larger story . Even something as mundane as , " Why is the character speaking to the landlord ? " has a motivation behind it ( or it should ) . Is she hoping to get a lower rent , or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a clue that your character needs to solve a mystery ? Is she looking for a date ? The motivations matter and can greatly change how a character acts in any given scene . Know their motivations and write accordingly . <h> Pay attention to speech <p> Your characters need to speak like real people , only without all the " ums " and " likes " that go on in real conversation . That means that they might speak in a dialect , or with an accent . They might have a peculiar speech pattern due to mental illness or a tic . They may speak like a well-educated person or a poorly educated one . There will be gender differences , as well . Good dialogue that matches the characters is hard to pull off ( go easy on the slang and dialect to avoid annoying the reader , but make it apparent that its there ) but its essential . Otherwise , all your characters sound the same and that 's boring ( not to mention difficult on the reader ) . Observe people who speak like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Do n't  deviate from their nature <p> If you 've spent the entire book creating a needy , shy , retiring character , you can not suddenly have that character fearlessly charge into battle and start slaying bad guys . You have to be true to the character . Doing otherwise feels forced and will turn readers off . If your character is going to change , it will not happen suddenly . You will have to spend time crafting that change so that when it finally happens , it feels believable . <p> Creating a believable character is n't easy . You cant skimp on the details and hope that people just buy into your character . You have to give readers reasons to care and believe and that can only come through careful thought , research , and observation . Just slapping a person on the page and hoping for the best will have your readers reaching for the next story . Do n't  cop out and write a fictional version of yourself . Readers can tell when you 've done this . Give your characters their own unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more willing to read the story you 're telling .

@@12747265 @1347265/ <h> Tag : how many pages is <p> This- is a question we get from time to time . There are instances- when you 're given an assignment , not by word count , but assigned by the number of pages . For example , " Write a paper four pages long . " If you get an assignment to write four pages , one of the first questions that will likely come to mind is , " How many words are in four pages ? " If you need to figure out words per page , you can use a words per page calculator . <p> The truth is there is no definitive answer to this question . The number of words it will take to fill a page will depend on a number of factors including the type of font used , the font size , spacing elements , the margins used on the paper , the paragraph length , etc . For example , if the assignment says the writing should be in 10-point font , its going to take a greater number of words to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For those who need a general rule of thumb , a typical page which has 1-inch margins and is typed in 12 point font with standard spacing elements will be approximately 500 words when typed single spaced . For assignments that require double spacing , it would take approximately 250 words to fill the page . For an assignment that requires you to write four pages , you can make the estimation that you 'll need to write approximately 2000 words for a single spaced paper , or 1000 words if the assignment is double spaced . Again , the type of font used can make the word count higher or lower , but its a good rule of thumb for those who are simply looking for a general estimation . <p> Since there can be a large variation on the number of words needed to fill a page , most papers are no longer assigned by page count . They are instead assigned by word count . That is , an assignment , essay or paper will likely be assigned as 1500 2000 words rather than 3 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer to " game the system " by using large fonts and excessive spacing to meet the writing criteria . <p> If you are given a writing assignment with a page number , the best thing to do is go directly to the person who made the assignment and ask for a word count . This will take away all the variations and help ensure your writing assignment meets expectations . If its for something informal and you simply need a general guideline , you can find it below . <h> How many pages is <p> The below list is an approximation , and actual pages will differ depending on a number of factors mentioned earlier in this article .

@@12747266 @1347266/ <h> Elizabeth Gilbert TED Talk : Your Elusive Creative Genius <p> If you 're a writer or an artist of any type for that matter , this is a TED talk that you 'll want to watch . Elizabeth Gilbert , the author of " Eat , Pray , Love " talks about the impossible things society seems to expect from artists and geniuses . She then provides the radical idea that instead of some individuals " being " geniuses , instead all artists " have " a genius as part of us . Her personal anecdotes , humorous style and surprisingly insightful thoughts about being an artist will make you question how you see yourself and other artists . See for yourself : <p> The talk delves into the expectations of those who choose creativity as a career / life choice , and how creative people manage the emotional risks of being an artist . If you have ever had any fears about the quality of your writing or have had others instill doubt about the artistic profession you have chosen to pursue , Elizabeth Gilbert has some advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progresses . <p> The main focus of the talk is about fear and doubt about being a writer ( or another artist ) and questioning why this comes about . Society as a whole seems to have an uneasiness regarding those who decide to go into an artistic occupation . As Gilbert points out , people do n't  question those who are chemical engineers about whether they have fears about their profession as they often do to writers . <p> After taking the time to explain how artistic ability went from being considered an outside force in ancient times to being considered solely the product of the individual in more recent times , she questions if this is a good thing . Can the average artist survive when the expectations continue to grow and grow ? <p> The solution to the problem is elegantly simple . Its to step back and take a hint from earlier times . Instead of everything being solely the responsibility of the individual , realize that the " artistic inspiration " is n't something that can necessarily be willed into being . For this , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct and separate part of you . That is , you 're doing the work , and you will do the work required on a daily basis , and you have the confidence that the inspiration will come to make it complete . <p> While this might sound quite complicated , it is n't . Gilbert does an excellent job explaining the artists inspiration through examples so even those who do n't  have an artistic background can understand the conflict which needs to be resolved . Most artists will instantly understand her fears and have likely experienced similar one to some degree during their career . While greatly beneficial to all those pursuing the arts , my guess is that this video may be even more beneficial to the partners of artists who may be able to get a better glimpse of the struggles and fears they must face when doing their trade . <p> If you have an extra 20 minutes to spare , sit down and watch this video right now . If you do n't  , bookmark the video so that you can come back when you do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you thinking about how society views those in the arts , and may give you some insight on how you can help yourself stay sane while doing what you love . <p> Actually , this TED talk is one of the worst ones I have ever watched . She makes no points , offers no advice , and spend the whole time talking about how she will never live up to Eat Pray Love , but how that 's ok , because reasons , stupid reasons , and I hope I can save you the time of watching this utterly pointless TED talk . Dear OP : Have you nothing better to write about ? <p> I liked it . I do n't  think it was trying to give a specific point-by-point map for you to follow . I think the main point was to get you thinking about expectations with your writing and to ultimately right for yourself . 
@@12747267 @1347267/ <h> Tag : reading level <p> If you came to Word Counter to find out how many words happened to be in a piece you 'd written , youve likely noticed we offer a lot more information than just word count . While we started out primarily as a simple way for you to be able to count the number of words you had written , we 've added a number of other Details to the counter over time . Currently , Word Counter offers 10 different " Details " areas located on the top right sidebar which can help you better understand your writing . The 10 Details options include the following : <p> Words : This tells you how many words you have written . <p> Unique Words : This tells you the number of unique words you have written . In the previous sentence , 11 words were written , but only 10 unique words were written because the word " you " was written twice . <p> Characters : This tells you the number of character spots which have been used including the blank spaces between words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This tells you the number of characters you 've written not counting the blank spaces between words . <p> Sentences : This tells you the number of sentences you 've written . <p> Avg . Sentence ( words ) : This tells you the average word length of all the sentences you 've written . For example , if you write two sentences and one is 10 words and the other is 8 words , the average sentence length would be 9 words . <p> Avg . Sentence ( chars ) : This tells you the average number of characters in each sentence . This calculation includes the blank spaces between the words . <p> Paragraphs : This tells you the number of paragraphs you 've written . <p> Reading Level : Reading level gives an approximation of what grade level the person reading your writing would need to have completed to understand what you have written . You can get a better understanding of reading level here . <p> Reading Time : Reading time gives you an estimate of how long it would take for you to read what you have written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words per minute . <p> There 's a good chance that you are n't  currently seeing all of the above-mentioned Details in your sidebar . That 's because only six are turned on by default when you visit the site . The default Details shown are Words , Characters , Sentences , Paragraphs , Reading Level , and Reading Time . The other four ( Unique Words , Characters no spaces , Average Sentence words , and Average Sentence characters ) have to be turned on for you to see them . <p> In order to see all of the above 10 metrics displayed , you can click the " Options " button ( at the bottom right of Word Counter writing area ) . Once in " Options , " you can then choose " Details " at the top . This will show all of the above-mentioned Details options and allow you to turn " off " or " on " the different options . In this way , you can customize the Details you want to be displayed exactly as you desire in the top right sidebar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counter . If you have suggestions on other Details you think would be valuable to you as a writer to display , please contact us with your suggestions or leave a comment below . many of the Details we display came from writers like you who suggested we add them . <p> One of the tracking features Word Counter provides in the " Details " section on the right side of the tool is a Reading Level . Of all the metrics the tool keeps track of , this is probably the one we receive the most questions about . With that in mind , we felt it would be beneficial to try to- explain in a little bit more detail how this metric works and what exactly it means . <p> First and foremost , Reading Level is n't a reflection of your writing skill in any way . You may have excellent writing which ranks at a fourth-grade reading level , while you may have substandard writing which ranks at the college reading level . There seems to be an assumption by many that a higher Reading Level rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading Level at a college level is better writing than a Reading Level at a tenth-grade level . This is not what this metric is measuring . <p> The only thing the Reading Level tries to do is give an indicator of the education level a person would need to have- in order to understand the words you 're using in your writing . Its not meant to be a ranking of your writing ability in any way . Its simply a general guideline so you can anticipate what education level a person would need to have- to understand what you have written . <p> WordCounter assesses Reading Level by using the Dale " Chall readability formula . This formula uses 3,000 common words a fourth grader should understand as its foundation . Basically , if you use only the words found in the list of 3,000 words when you write , your Reading Level rank will be at a fourth-grade level . As you use more words which are not on the list of 3,000 words , the Reading Level will increase . The more words you use that fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the Reading Level feature will assign to your writing . <p> When you first begin to type in the text area , Reading Level will display as N/A . In order for a Reading Level to appear , you will need to write a minimum of two sentences . The number of sentences is part of the formula used , and the more sentences in the writing , the more accurate the Readability Level will be . There 's a need for a two-sentence minimum to begin to make an accurate Reading Level determination . <p> With this in mind , when the metric shows your writing at " college level , " what its saying is that you 're using a significant number of words in your writing which a fourth grader wont be familiar with . If the Reading Level says fourth-grade level , then a fourth-grader would understand the vast majority of the words you used in your writing . If the metric says a seventh-grade level , you 're using some words that a typical fourth-grader would n't understand , but not as many as would be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reading Level may be important for a number of reasons . If you are attempting to target your article , story or other writing to a specific audience who may be at a certain reading grade level , this metric can help make sure you 're not writing over their heads . At the same time , you may not want your writing to come across as too simplistic by using only common words elementary students would understand , and want to raise the number and variety of vocabulary in your writing to appeal to a higher educated reader . <p> This word counter tool originally counted words , characters , and letters . As more people found it , we started to get requests of what the users would like to see added to the tool . Over the years , we have added many of these suggestions . We continue to strive to keep this tool updated and to add new features which users have requested which make word counter more beneficial to all . We recently added the following features which you can now use : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top left of the Word Counter tool which says " Spell Check " Once you have finished writing , you can click this button and a spell and grammar check will be performed on what you have written and will highlight areas of the writing that may be grammatically incorrect or have spelling issues . Its important to note that this should n't be exclusively relied upon , and as with all writing , you should proofread what you have written , but it may catch some minor errors you missed or show you an area of your writing which may be able to be more clearly rewritten . <h> Different Cases <p> There may be instances where you want to have your writing ( or certain portions of your writing ) displayed in a certain way . The " Case " button just to the right of the " Spell Check " button gives you four options to display your writing in different ways . There are two ways to use this . You can highlight a certain portion of your writing , and only the highlighted portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you highlight your first paragraph and choose " Uppercase , " then only the first paragraph will be turned to upper case and the rest of the writing will remain as it was . If you choose one of the options without highlighting any of your writing , the entire writing will be formatted by the choice you made . The four choices available are : <p> Lowercase : when you choose this option , all writing will be displayed in lowercase like this . even after periods , the letters will all be in lowercase . <p> Title Case : Also referred to as title capitalization , this gives the proper way to capitalize titles for your writing , articles and blog posts . It can often get confusing which words should and should n't be capitalized in the title of the paper , and by choosing this option , it will automatically give you the correct way to display it . For example , the title of this article , " Title capitalization , spell check and more new word counter tools " gets transformed to " Title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the title case option is used . <p> Sentence Case : This options will turn all the writing to a typical sentence construction . This can be convenient if you happen to forget to capitalize after periods , or if you tried some of the other case options , but decide you want to back to normal . <h> Reading Level <p> On the right side under " Details " , there is now a section at the bottom that displays Reading Level . The reading level is calculated by using the Dale " Chall readability formula based on 3,000 common words fourth graders understand . This can be useful if you 're writing to a certain age group to make sure your writing is n't above or below their level . <h> Keyword Density Options <p> Under " Options " ( top right corner ) you can now choose the number of keywords you want displayed for keyword density . The default has been 10 words , but you can choose as few or as many as you wish to fit the particular type of writing you 're doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to word counter , feel free to contact us or to leave a comment .

@@12747268 @1347268/ <h> Further Away versus Farther Away <p> There are times when English can be confusing , even to native speakers who learned the language from the cradle . One of the common areas of confusion arises when we have to choose between two words which seem to be almost the same . Learning to properly understand the different uses of different words is one aspect of improving your vocabulary . <p> For example , the question whether to use " further away " or " farther away " can be confusing . They look very similar , and their meanings are similar too . When were talking , few people would even notice the difference , but when were writing , we need to be more precise and choose our words carefully . How will we know when to use " further " and when to use " farther ? " Luckily , there 's a very simple way to work it out when you proofread your writing . Its the difference between literal distance and figurative distance . <h> Distances can be literal or figurative <p> When we refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example : <p> " How much farther will we have to drive to reach our hotel ? " <p> In this example , the person asking the question is looking for a literal distance . They want to know how many miles they will have to travel to reach their destination . " Farther " is completely correct in this context . <p> In the following example , our distance is figurative : <p> " Would you like me to explain this further ? " <p> Obviously , the answer here ca n't be " Five miles " because we are n't  looking at a literal distance . <p> The good news is there 's a simple and useful trick to remembering the difference . To make your life easier , you can remember the correct use for " farther " by looking at the first syllable , " Far . " Now think of all the distance measurements . There are miles , kilometers , centimeters , inches and so on . Would you associate these measurements with what you are going to say ? If so , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to be 100% correct . <p> Now consider " further " as being an " add-on " : <p> " You can have a further $5 . " " It will be a further year before you finish your studies . " " I was further insulted by her rude behavior on Sunday . " <p> It tells you that something extra is going to be added . <h> Interchangeability : just to make you more confused <p> Now that we have a clear explanation of when to use the word " farther " rather than " further " its time to muddy the waters a little . Although you should n't use " farther " at times when " further " is the more appropriate choice , there are times when you can use " further " instead of " farther . " There are even some who advise you to choose " further " when in doubt . <p> People have been using these two words interchangeably for a long time , and in other parts of the world where English is spoken , " further " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " farther " at all . But if you want to fit in with accepted modern American grammar , its important to remember the simple distinction between the literal distance " farther " and the figurative distance " further . " If you are writing a report or an essay , you need to choose the correct word , and the usages weve just discussed are accepted as correct in both the Chicago Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook . <p> But there are still cases in American grammar in which we will find that the two words are interchangeable . For instance : <p> " How much farther do you have to read ? " and " How much further do you have to read ? " would both be correct . After all , you could be asking someone how many pages they still need to read to finish the book , or you could be asking if they will have to read more books or more chapters to get the information they need . In the first example , you 're asking for a literal distance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're asking for a figurative distance . As with so many other grammar rules , context is very important . <p> Let 's keep it simple . If reading this has made you more confused than ever , then just hold onto this thought : <p> " Farther " is a distance and " further " is something extra . How easy is that ? <p> Its always great to see that people find the articles useful . If this article has managed to help you understand the difference between further and farther , then it was 100% worth writing . I 'm glad that any confusion you had between these two words is no longer an issue . <p> Very enlightening article ! These two little words further and farther has definitely caused a bit of confusion in my world . Thanks for clearing this up for me : ) now I can expand my vocabulary furtherdid I say that right ? lol <p> I believe that these two words are not interchangeable . Farther is used when you talk about how far from a definite point of origin and destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destination . <p> This was a helpful article . A lot of people do get confused with words such as these . I think reading helps a lot with understanding what a certain word means . Frequent usage of these words in your sentences can also be helpful . <p> I teach English and this article is very useful for me . People sometimes mistakenly use these two , especially for non-native English speakers . However , I also agree that even native English speakers can get confused about this . <p> Most of my acquaintances , as well as myself , who use English as a second language , had been confused by this for quite some time . It made coffee breaks rather interesting though ! The simple explanations cleared things up . Now we have to find other stuff to argue about ! <p> My teacher sent me to this article so that I could better understand the difference between the two . They both still see to be about the same to me . I do n't  think teachers should care which one we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would be easiest for everyone involved . <p> As a student who is learning English as a second language , words like these are confusing . Further or farther they seem to be the same . I can never get them right . I wish English was n't so confusing ! ! <p> There are a lot like this . Who and whom is another example . Or except and accept . It can be difficult , especially those learning English as a second language . Further away is n't distance I now understand . That 's good to know . <p> " further " verses " farther " has always been one that confused me . Why did they have to make not only the meaning be so similar , but the spelling of the two words be so similar ? I think that 's what confuses a lot of people , too . Not only are their meanings almost the same , but the way they are pronounced and spelled are almost the same . Its no wonder people confuse further for farther and farther for further all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two words ? This is elementary level stuff . How did you ever get into junior high school not knowing this ? I guess this shows what out education has come to that adults do n't  even know the difference between these two words . <p> It does n't  pay to pass judgment when you do n't  know why a person is asking this question . There are a lot of people who are learning English , or who came to this country after growing up in another country . Yes , some people may not have had a good education , but my guess is that 's not why most of the people are trying to find out the difference . If this were the case , they would n't care what the difference was . You might want to show a little bit more consideration before you start making blanket statements . <p> I am learning English as my 4th language . Do you speak anything other t English ? Maybe you should think a bit more before trying to make yourself feel superior to others who are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have always struggled with seeing that English is my second language . I 'm so glad it was made easier to understand with this article . The words seem so alike its easy to confuse them . <p> Just leaving a note here to say " thank you " for writing this easy-to-understand explanation on further and further . As a homeschool mom , it makes it a lot easier when I come across explanations like this to teach my kids the difference . <p> I knew the answer to this because there was a radio spot for a local advanced learning school in my area that used it as part of the reason kids should attend . I was just checking to make sure they were correct in the way they explained it . <p> This seems overly complicated for two words that only have a single letter difference . I just use them interchangeably and nobody seems to notice the difference . If I can get my point across , what difference does it make ? 
@@12747269 @1347269/ <h> How to Reduce Your Essay Word Count <p> When it comes to writing essays , there are two frequent issues that arise ; the word count is either too low or too high for the stated range of the essay . For those who perpetually end up with too few words , you need to figure out ways to increase your essay word count . For those who frequently find themselves with too many words on the page , there are some simple steps to take when editing to help reduce the number of words while at the same time making it a stronger piece of writing . Below are some suggestions to do this . <h> Rank Your Arguments <p> If you find you 're well above your word count maximum , the first step is to rank the points you use to substantiate your argument . By ranking the importance of the arguments you make in the essay , you can eliminate ones which are n't  as important as others , keeping the essay strong while removing large portions of writing . If you do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce word count by mentioning all the arguments , but not writing as much detail about those not as strong as the more important points . <h> Focus on the Main Point <p> Once you determine what the important arguments are for your essay , read through it looking for any paragraphs or sentences which fail to address your main argument(s) or topic . Its easy to accidentally go off on tangents when writing , and eliminating these tangents can help reduce word count . The more focused you can remain on your topic and arguments , the more concise your writing will be . <h> Use the Best Verb <p> This may sound obvious , but a lot of writers do n't  do this well . When writing , always use the perfect verb rather than one that 's close , but not perfect . When you use the best verb possible , it will reduce the amount of writing you do in most cases . This is due to the fact that when you use a verb that 's not quite correct , you usually need to add more words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They beat the opposing team by a lot of points . " <p> While " beat " is accurate in this case , its not the perfect verb because they not only beat the team , they beat the team by a lot . Using the better verb " trounce " in this instant will reduce the word count while still giving the same meaning as the longer sentence . <p> " They trounced the opposing team . " <h> Remove Adverbs <p> Look through your essay and see if you find any adverbs , especially adverbs which have " ly " endings . In many instances , these adverbs end up being filler words which end up being placed in the writing because its the way we talk , but the words do n't  add anything beneficial to the actual essay . Go through the essay and ask if each one is needed and remove those that are n't  . Some words you may want to look out for are ( click on image to expand to see better ) <h> Remove Adjectives <p> Much in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjectives are used when one ( or none at all ) would suffice . Read the essay to see if all of the adjectives used are needed , and remove those which do n't  add to the meaning of the sentence being written . Some common adjectives to look for are : <p> This is such a challenge sometimes . I hate editing because I love all my words . It helps to know how to reduce the word count even though I do n't  want to do it . I think teachers should let us write as much as we want . Isnt that helping us to be better students than limiting the amount we can write ? <p> Limiting the amount you can write is actually something that can help you write better . It forces you to clean up your writing and only make the most necessary points which will make it more concise and accurate . Editing is more important than the actual writing to write well for most people . Your teacher is doing you a great service by limiting the amount you can write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world revolves around them and not understanding that just because its not a problem they have , others cant have it . A very narrow world view . You might want to actually try and see things from the perspective of others every once in awhile . <p> I write too much . I wordy . I always have to reduce word count . Its as much of n issue for me is not having enough words is for you . I hate it when people dismiss problems of others jus because it happens not to be a problem for them . <p> I 'm wordy . Far too wordy . I do my best writing when I have to edit myself and these ideas are good places for me to begin . I wish I could stay under my professors word count limits , but it never happens I guess its better than writers block , but its still an issue . <p> Editing is such an under appreciated part of writing . I love the quote that says that great writing is composed on the editing block . Reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an opportunity to improve your writing . Being able to get your point across concisely is a great skill to have . <p> I agree . Most students do n't  realize the importance of good editing and how it can greatly improve their writing . I believe students should spend at least as much time editing their essays as they do writing them . <p> This is soooooo true and they do n't  really teach you this in school . They tell you to write , but not to edit . I would have loved it if I was given a document that I had to keep the same meaning and important points , but shorten it by 200 words . Its a skill I did n't  learn well in school but you need in the real world . <p> This is a new problem for me . I used to always be under word count , but recently I 've started to always go over word count . I thought that being under was bad , but being over seems to be even more difficult . I 'm not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under word count . <p> Editing is a lot like writing . The more you practice , the better you will get at it . Do n't  get frustrated and continue to work on your editing skills . Youll be surprised at how much better your writing gets the more you practice them . Good luck ! <p> Seriously , who ever needs to reduce their essay word count ? Everyone I know is always trying to make their word count . Do these people just write random things to get that high of a word count ? That makes no sense <p> ha ha . I assume you 're still in middle or high school with a comment like this . One day you 'll learn that writing can be fun and interesting , and when that happens , you wont have enough space to write everything you want . <p> I do n't  know if you were being serious or not , but for some people that 's easier said than done . I tend to be wordy in my first drafts , and so when I go back through I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wrote the exact number of words required the first time through , my grades would be a lot worse than they are . When I edit , I make my essays a lot better . I think most people do . If you 're only writing first drafts of any assignment , you 're not putting your best work forward . While your advice seems like its simple , it actually is bad advice for those who want to get good grades . <p> I think its difficult for people who have a hard time reaching a word count minimum to understand how difficult it is for those of us who have a hard time staying under word count . Although they are completely opposite problems , they are just as difficult for both sides . Its kind of like two sides of the same coin . <p> What if you have a lot to say on the topic ? Should I just dumb down my writing because the teacher says that I have a maximum word count that I 'm not supposed to exceed ? Sometimes its important to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recently have found that I no longer have trouble reaching assigned word counts , but now I am constantly going over them . I 'm not sure how this happened . Even worse , I think being over word count is even harder than being under it . Who would have thought ? <p> I think this is a common problem as people become better writers . As you become more confident in your writing , you tend to write more . The previous writing problems turn into editing problems . the good news is that as you get better at writing , your wordiness will tend to go down again . Just like it to practice to increase your word count , it will take practice to reduce your word count as well . <p> I happened to be a wordy writer . I never seem to be able to stay under the assigned word count on my essays . I found that one of the best ways to reduce the amount that I write is to take the time to outline before I even start writing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , I know my writing is going to be long . That gives me the opportunity to focus on the most important points of the essay which helps to keep the word count down . I do n't  know if this will work for everybody , but it works well for me and I thought I would share it in case it helps somebody else . <p> That 's easy to say , but how do you learn to edit well ? I want to reduce the number of words in my essays , but they all seem important . I do n't  want to edit out words that are important to the essay . If all seem important , then how do you choose which ones to eliminate ? <p> Practice . Editing is like writingthe more you do it , the better you become . You do n't  even have to write to practice editing . take something someone else has written and see if you can make it read more cleanly . It can be fun and addicting. 
@@12747270 @1347270/ <h> Month : April 2016 <p> For those who are just beginning to type , they are often interested in the answer to the question , " what is an average typing speed ? " The average typing speed is 36 words per minute . Typing speed is usually measured in words per minute , but as most people have noticed , words have different lengths . Depending on your profession , you may need to type longer words than in other professions . For example , if you 're a legal typist , you 're probably typing longer words than most people do . For this reason , the best way to measure typing speed is in characters per minute . The average typing speed , in this case , is about 187 characters per minute . <h> What 's a good typing speed ? <p> A good typing speed for most people is 40 words per minute or over . This would give you a word count of 2400 words per hour if you could sustain the pace for sixty minutes . There are people who can type a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional typist , you can probably type 75 words per minute , and maybe even more . What 's the world record ? Believe it or not , its 150 words per minute , and that was measured over a sustained period . When given a shorter time frame , our world-record typist could reach a speed of 212 words per minute . In other words , she can type much faster than most people can talk . <h> How can I improve my typing speed ? <p> Have a good keyboard : Improving your typing speed takes practice and good equipment . If you have to hammer certain keys a few times before they registered , its obviously going to take you longer to type than if you have equipment which performs well . If you spend a good portion of your day on the computer , its worth investing in a good keyboard . <p> Learn how to touch type : Touch typing means that you do n't  have to look at your keyboard when you 're typing words . You just monitor your screen as you type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingers . If you are someone who one or two-finger types , you 'll never be in a position to be a quick typer . Luckily , you do n't  have to sign up for expensive lessons : there are plenty of free touch typing games and apps available . Simply do a search for " free online touch typing " and you should have plenty of resources from which to choose/ <p> Posture is important : You may find that you need to alter the height of your chair to get into a correct typing posture . Experts say that you should be able to sit up straight and that your elbows should be bent at a 90-degree angle . Your wrists can rest lightly on the table , but do n't  put weight on them . When your fingers hover over the home row the middle row of letters , they should be slightly bent . <p> Use your keyboard shortcuts : Copying , pasting , undoing or finding a word in your text can easily be done with a few simple keyboard shortcuts . There 's no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy on your keyboard , learning your shortcuts will help to save you time . <p> Practice , practice , practice : Practice , as they say , makes perfect . So the more you practice your touch typing , the faster you 'll get . Spend half an hour to an hour on practice every day , and you 'll be amazed at how quickly your typing speed can improve ! <p> Take your time : Its worth taking your time to learn accuracy rather than rushing to complete as many words per minute as possible before returning to correct them . Corrections take up time , so getting things right the first time around will help you to improve your overall speed . You 'll still have to check your work , but if you follow the rules of touch typing and keep your eyes on the screen , there should n't be much to correct . <p> Improving your typing speed will make you more productive and will help you to capture your thoughts before the inspiration disappears . <p> When people talk about books , there 's usually the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is why most writers focus on daily word count . They know they have to write a certain number of words each day if they hope to complete their book . <p> If you are n't  a good writer , you likely assume its impossible to make money creating and selling books . This assumption is actually not correct . In fact , there 's a thriving business with both " low content " and " no content " books these days . <h> What is a no content book ? <p> A no content book usually refers to a book that has no written content in it . That does n't  mean it only has blank pages ( although it can ) . It simply means there are n't  any words in the book . A couple of examples of no content books would be a blank journal that only has lines for writing or an adult coloring book . If its a book that does n't  have written content in it , then it can be considered a no content book even if it contains other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A low content book is one that contains some written content , but far less than one would find in a typical book . A journal that had inspirational quotes on each page would be considered a low content book . A day planner with the days of the week and months listed would be another example . A mileage tracking book for the miles you drive your car each day of the week would be another . Even a recipe book could be considered a low content book . While low content books do have some written content , its a lot less than would be typically found when one imagines a book . <h> Can you make money with no and low content book ? <p> Yes , its possible to make money with no content and low content books . These types of books are selling like hot-cakes on various sites including Amazons Create Space . Currently , coloring books for adults are some of the best-selling books on Amazon , no content or otherwise . Journals always sell well if they can capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come up with any niche where these types of books are in demand , they will sell well . <h> Who buys no and low content books ? <p> While it makes sense individuals would buy these books if they meet their specific needs , its not only individuals . Large corporations , chain stores , and small groups may often buy these books as well . Many are used as corporate gifts or novelty items . <p> If you are n't  a good enough writer or have the patience to produce a novel , no and low content books may be a perfect alternative for you if you have the goal to publish a book . Now that you understand what these types of books are , you might be surprised at how many opportunities there are out there to produce them . Keep your eyes open and you will see how many of these books exist which can be produced with a minimal amount of effort ( at least in comparison to writing a novel ) . <p> When searching for an alphabetical list of all 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed in a way that makes it difficult to copy for your own use . Many times they 're displayed in two to four columns so when its copied , the states are n't  in alphabetical order when pasted into a new document . For that reason , we have creates a list of all 50 states in alphabetical order in a single column so it can be used by others who need it for school , business or some other project . <p> There may also be times when you need an alphabetical list of states , but with them numbered . This allows you to easily see what number each stated is within the 50 states . This can be more helpful for certain projects compared to a list with no numbers . You can find the numbered list below . <p> While these are the two most common alphabetical list of states people need , you may need one presented in a different way . Fortunately , the Alphabetical Order Tool will allow you to manipulate this 50 state list in a number of different ways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simply copy the list and then paste it into the text area of the alphabetize tool . Once done , you can add any custom text needed to the list . <p> Another advantage of the alphabetize tool is that inputting the 50 state list will make it printable . Having a printable alphabetized list of states can be useful for a number of projects and is something people are often seeking when they are searching for these lists . <p> For teachers who need a list to use for giving tests , the following may be of use : <p> Again , teachers can use the Alphabetize Tool to manipulate the list to fit their exact needs , then print it out for their classes . <p> If you 're looking for an alphabetized list of the 50 states that is n't listed above , but you feel a lot of others would benefit from having access to , please leave a comment and we can add it to this article . <p> If you deal with lists , you know making changes to them can be a hassle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many situations when its beneficial to put a list into alphabetical order .

That is , your search was likely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keywords ? " rather than simply " keywords " . For those looking to drive traffic to blogs or websites , understanding how these phrases work is an important tool to generating that traffic . For this reason , its important to understand what they are and how they can be of benefit for driving traffic . <h> What are long tail keywords ? <p> Long tail keywords are those three or more keyword phrases which are specific to whatever you are writing about or selling . You see , whenever a customer uses a highly specific search phrase , they tend to be looking for exactly what they input into the search engine . In virtually every case , such very specific searches are far more likely to convert to sales or bring traffic to a specific page than general generic searches . That 's because general searches tend to be geared more toward the type of research that consumers typically do prior to making a buying decision or when doing general research . <p> Before we begin , a basic understanding of keywords is important . Think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us assume you own a shop selling SCUBA diving equipment . Customers doing a general search would type in " SCUBA " which would be your keyword . Their search engine will return results ranked according to the most relevant information . <p> However , since there are millions of references to the term " SCUBA " and with thousands of shops around the world selling SCUBA equipment and providing information about SCUBA diving , your site will be drowned out among all the noise . You would be lucky if it ranked on page 500 . <p> When it comes to driving traffic to your site , customers are usually a lot more specific . They do n't  want a million results . They may only want a few . They do n't  simply make use of a single keyword . They will make use of several specific words which are referred to as long-tail keywords . For example , a customer based in San Diego is not going to go looking for a SCUBA shop in Africa . <p> The customer will want the shop closest to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a more likely search than just " SCUBA " . The browser would return information specific to that phrase , thus eliminating all the competition that 's not in the San Diego area . Remember , you 're aiming for quality over quantity . Now your website may rank on page 30 , a vast improvement but not good enough . You still need to improve your SEO ranking . <h> How do I improve my ranking ? <p> Improving your ranking is what is known as search engine optimization ( SEO ) . It makes your site more relevant and easier for the search engines to find . First you will need to be able to identify keyword phrases that are relevant to your business or website . <h> How to identify long tail keywords <p> There are various approaches to identifying these keyword phrases . A good place to begin is what phrases you would use to search for information that 's found on your webpages . Ask friend and family what words they would use and you should come up with some good long tail phrases for your particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your keyword phrase , you should incorporate them into the URL of your new post . It does n't  matter if you are using WordPress , Weebly or Joomla , you 're able to edit the suggested URL . For example , let us assume your domain name is www.scuba.com . Your long tail keyword is " scuba equipment San Diego " your URL would look something like **39;1004;TOOLONG <h> In the post title <p> Your posts title should begin with your keyword phrase . For example , the long tail keyword for this particular article is " what are long tail keywords ? " The heading begins with this phrase , followed by a basic explanation . <p> So , back to your SCUBA shop you would have a heading along the lines of " SCUBA equipment San Diego on sale now ! " You also want to keep the title of your post under 70 characters in length as titles that are too long can hurt the seo of the article or page . <h> Paragraph headings , body and stuffing <p> You should aim to include your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should also try to include it a few times throughout the body of your text . However , you do n't  want to repeat the phrase too often . If you repeat the phrase too often , you can be penalized for keyword stuffing , and this is where the keyword density tool comes in handy when you 're writing . If you read through this article you will note I have not used " What Are Long Tail Keywords ? " more than 5 times in the body of the text . <h> SEO for Images and Meta descriptions <p> A final consideration is to include your keyword phrase in the alt-description of any images that may appear in your post . You should also include it somewhere in the Meta description . Some people search by image rather than by article . By doing this you will drive people to your website through image searches they do as well as the content . <p> It can take time for this process to work , but by focusing on phrases which apply to your website rather than single words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher in the search engines and driving more traffic to your website . <p> If you 're a writer or an artist of any type for that matter , this is a TED talk that you 'll want to watch . Elizabeth Gilbert , the author of " Eat , Pray , Love " talks about the impossible things society seems to expect from artists and geniuses . She then provides the radical idea that instead of some individuals " being " geniuses , instead all artists " have " a genius as part of us . Her personal anecdotes , humorous style and surprisingly insightful thoughts about being an artist will make you question how you see yourself and other artists . See for yourself : <p> The talk delves into the expectations of those who choose creativity as a career / life choice , and how creative people manage the emotional risks of being an artist . If you have ever had any fears about the quality of your writing or have had others instill doubt about the artistic profession you have chosen to pursue , Elizabeth Gilbert has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career progresses . <p> The main focus of the talk is about fear and doubt about being a writer ( or another artist ) and questioning why this comes about . Society as a whole seems to have an uneasiness regarding those who decide to go into an artistic occupation . As Gilbert points out , people do n't  question those who are chemical engineers about whether they have fears about their profession as they often do to writers . <p> After taking the time to explain how artistic ability went from being considered an outside force in ancient times to being considered solely the product of the individual in more recent times , she questions if this is a good thing . Can the average artist survive when the expectations continue to grow and grow ? <p> The solution to the problem is elegantly simple . Its to step back and take a hint from earlier times . Instead of everything being solely the responsibility of the individual , realize that the " artistic inspiration " is n't something that can necessarily be willed into being . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a distinct and separate part of you . That is , you 're doing the work , and you will do the work required on a daily basis , and you have the confidence that the inspiration will come to make it complete . <p> While this might sound quite complicated , it is n't . Gilbert does an excellent job explaining the artists inspiration through examples so even those who do n't  have an artistic background can understand the conflict which needs to be resolved . Most artists will instantly understand her fears and have likely experienced similar one to some degree during their career . While greatly beneficial to all those pursuing the arts , my guess is that this video may be even more beneficial to the partners of artists who may be able to get a better glimpse of the struggles and fears they must face when doing their trade . <p> If you have an extra 20 minutes to spare , sit down and watch this video right now . If you do n't  , bookmark the video so that you can come back when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will get you thinking about how society views those in the arts , and may give you some insight on how you can help yourself stay sane while doing what you love . <p> When you are writing an essay for a class which has a minimum of maximum word count limit , the question of whether or not footnotes and endnotes should be counted toward this limit can come up . Those who have an essay that is under word count are hoping that their footnotes and endnotes can be counted while those who are over the limit want to make sure that these do n't  count . Which one is it ? <h> Footnotes <p> Do footnotes count when doing a word count ? No , footnotes do n't  count in the word count in most cases . When a teacher or professor gives an assignment with a minimum or maximum limit , its usually done with the intent of being applicable to the topic being assigned . Footnotes are auxiliary information that further clarifies certain points being made in the essay . Since this is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and professors do not count footnotes as part of the essays word count . <p> This is a general rule of thumb . There can be exceptions depending on the teacher giving the assignment , so the best policy is to ask the person assigning the essay whether or not footnotes should or should n't be included . If this is not possible , its best to assume that they are not counted . <p> Do footnotes count in a page count ? Yes , footnotes generally count toward page count . Footnotes are found at the bottom of the page and do n't  take up much of the page space in most instances . While its relatively easy to exclude footnotes from a word count , its much more difficult to exclude them from a page count . For this reason , most professors allow them to be included as part of the overall page count . <p> Again , counting footnotes as part of the page count is a general rule of thumb , not a definitive answer . Its always best to ask the person assigning the essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself in a position where this is n't possible , in most cases it should be acceptable . <h> Endnotes <p> Do endnotes count in a word count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a word count in most cases . Much like footnotes , endnotes give further information to a point made in an essay but are n't  part of the body of the essay . For this reason , endnotes are generally not included in an essays word count . The best policy is to ask directly if you are n't  sure about this , but when in doubt , its better not to count them . <p> Do endnotes count in a page count ? No , endnotes do n't  count as part of a page count most of the time . There is one significant difference between footnotes and endnotes which is endnotes are found at the end of the essay and not at the bottom of each page . Being at the end , its much easier to exclude them from a page count than it is to exclude footnotes . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assignment with a specific page count . <p> Have you ever wondered what the longest word in the English language is ? Did you think back to childhood days and recall Mary Poppins describing **34;1045;TOOLONG as a word used when you have nothing else to say ?

So , where does that leave us ? <h> What is the longest word in the dictionary ? <p> The longest non-technical word found in the dictionary is **29;1081;TOOLONG . The term is used to describe something of worthless value . This is ironic because this 29 lettered word serves little purpose , except when used as an example of a long word . It certainly is n't used in everyday English . <p> Coming in at just 28 letters , and one that most people would be able to pronounce is the word **28;1112;TOOLONG .

Smith , president of the National Puzzlers League to capture the longest word in the English dictionary . <h> What is the longest word ? <p> If you are looking for a truly long word , consider that it has 189,819 letters . It would take you more than three hours to pronounce correctly , that 's if you were able to pronounce it in its entirety without a mistake and did not have to start from the beginning again . <p> The abbreviation is LONG ... Since this post has no intention of being the longest blog post ever , the full word will not be shown . If you 're truly interested in this word , you can watch it being pronounced on YouTube . <p> Good luck with trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off to your friends since it takes over three hours to pronounce . It basically describes a type of protein which provides elasticity in muscles . <h> What is the longest place name ? <p> The longest place name from an English speaking country is 85 letters in length . LONG ... is a Maori word for a particular hill in New Zealand . <h> What is the longest town name ? <p> With just 58 letters , the Welsh town of LONG ... is the longest name of a town or city in the world . It translates as St. Marys Church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool of Llantysilio of the red cave . The abbreviation Llanfair PG . is usually employed and the town was so named to be the longest place name in Britain . <h> What is the longest word with only vowels ? <p> The longest word to contain only vowels is euouae . Although the word only comprises six letters , it has the distinction of holding two Guinness World Records . These are for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being the word with the most consecutive vowels . Although this word is not commonly used , it refers to a musical term from the medieval times . <h> What is the longest word with only consonants ? <p> The longest word to contain only consonants is tsktsk .

It refers to one who does not indulge in the excessive intake of food , alcohol or narcotics . You certainly checked that . <h> Conclusion <p> There are many other really long words . Many of these are very technical or are words used to describe chemical composition . For example , a DNA strand could run into several thousand letters . However , these technical terms often contain numerals or letters from the Greek alphabet . As such they are not considered to be true English words . <p> Although these words all contain a stupendous amount of letters , for those who still like childhood riddles , by far the longest word of all is smiles . Why is this ? Because it has a MILE between the first and last letters , silly ! <p> For anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that usually comes to mind is , " How many words is that going to be ? " The problem is there is no set answer to this question . The number of words needed for a speech will depend heavily on the person giving the speech . <p> Some people speak slowly when giving a speech while others speak quickly . Those who speak quickly will need to write more words for each minute of their speech than those who speak at a slower pace . That being said , there are some general guidelines which can help you make an educated guess at approximately how many words will be needed for a speech . <p> The general rule for speech giving is 100 to 200 words per minute . With this in mind , a 10-minute speech would require 1,000 to 2,000 words . The WordCounter speaking time detail defaults 150 words per minute ( an average speed which would give a result of 1,500 words , as this is the recommended speed for audiobooks to be read at for best listening ) , but you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace . Simply click on " Options " then the " Details " tab and then the wrench next to the " Speaking Time " button . <p> If want to know how many words per minute ( WPM ) you personally say when giving a speech , you can use a timer to time yourself , then input that number into the options section . Time yourself for one minute of your speech , then copy to where you made it into WordCounter to see how many words you speak per minute . This will give you a more accurate estimate of how many words you must write for however long the speech you need to make will be . <p> Its important to remember that speech patterns can increase when a person is nervous . This means that even when determining the number of words needed for a 10-minute speech when practicing at home by yourself , you may actually need more during the actual speech if you get nervous . <p> While the number of words in a speech will depend heavily on how fast or slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for a basic estimate of how many words would be in a speech , you can use the following estimates . These estimates use the average speaking pace of 150 words per minute to estimate . <p> How many words in a 1-minute speech ? There are 150 words in a 1-minute speech . How many words in a 2-minute speech ? There are 300 words in a 2-minute speech . How many words in a 3-minute speech ? There are 450 words in a 3-minute speech . How many words in a 4-minute speech ? There are 600 words in a 4-minute speech . How many words in a 5-minute speech ? There are 750 words in a 5-minute speech . How many words in a 6-minute speech ?

I travel a lot which means I spend a lot of time in different places with different surroundings , and in most cases , I can make it work if I need to get something written . Even though I can write in most conditions , I have learned over the years that I write much more effectively when I have a specific surrounding that 's most conducive for my writing productivity . That 's what I try to create as my writing space at home . Having a quality writing space can help immensely when you 're trying to write 1000 words a day . <p> If you have read anything on productivity , and especially writing productivity , one of the suggestions often given is to find a quiet place in the time you set aside to write . This is essentially a good point , but what " quiet " means will depend a lot on your own personal preferences . What you really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an optimal level , and the chances are you are going to need to experiment a good amount to find what this exactly means for you . <p> It would be great to make a list of the perfect writing space , but the truth is what works for one writer may not work for the next . For example , I write much better while have the background noise of music playing , but I have writer friends who ca n't imagine having that distraction while trying to write . In the end , you will have to create your space for you , and that space will likely be different from other writers you know . That being said , I can list some of the choices I made when creating my space which you can use to consider what would be the best writing space for your needs . These are a few of the things I determined I needed for my space : <p> A restricted area where people cant regularly interrupt <p> No TV ( I learned early that if there was a TV in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my writing would end ) <p> Non-commercial music ( I write better with background noise , but only with music . I cant listen to radio where DJs speak as that ruins my writing rhythm ) <p> No phones ( and cell phones turned off ) <p> A good chair ( this is something I did n't  realize how important it was until I purchased a good chair ) <p> A notepad with paper ( I like to jot down notes about other possible articles when I write ) <p> A timer ( I set my writing for 20 minutes and then take a break ) <p> A drink , but no food ( A large glass of iced tea is essential , but any food is a distrction <p> Those above are some of the things I have found make me more productive when I write .

I find I can also write for longer periods of time if I do so . <p> This is some great advice when writing . You always need a quiet place with little to no distractions to help you focus on the task at hand . If you do n't  do this , its going to be difficult to write consistently over time . 
@@12747272 @1347272/ <h> Who vs Whom <p> When it comes to writing , there are some words that can be confusing as to which is the correct one to use . A good example of this confusion is further versus farther . Another common word duo many people have difficulty knowing which is correct is who and whom . <p> Very few people bother to use the word whom in spoken English , but when were writing , we want to use the correct grammar . Since we so seldom use whom , we are n't  always sure when it is the right choice , or when we should stick to the familiar who instead . <p> Most experts agree that if we are unsure , who is a safer bet . And its fine for informal writing after all whom is slowly disappearing from our language . However , if we have to produce formal written work , we do need to know when to use the mysterious whom . Put it in the wrong places , and you 'll look pompous and silly . Omit it when you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is picked up . <p> First of all , well look at the rule that governs the use of whom , and then , to make it easier for you , well look at a little cheat that you can use to test a sentence when you are n't  sure which of the two words belongs . <h> The rule governing the use of who and whom <p> Look at the verb in your sentence . Is who performing the action ? If so , who is the right choice to make . So who is the subject of a verb the one who is the doer ! <p> Who is there ? <p> Do you know who will attend the conference ? <p> Who threw that snowball ? <p> I got hit by a snowball and I want to know who threw it ! <p> This is the man who won the prize . <p> Youve probably already guessed that since you choose who when the person you 're referring to is the subject of your verb , you 'll use whom when the person becomes the object of the verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than being the one responsible for the action . <p> With whom were you out last night ? <p> We will inform those whom we shortlist . <p> Be selective about those whom you choose as friends . <p> To whom should the invoice be sent ? <h> An easy cheat <p> Although we tend to be confused about when to use the word who and the contexts in which whom is the correct choice , were much more familiar with the words he and him and they and them . We instinctively know which of the words in these pairs fit into any sentence . <p> You will have noticed that whom , him and them all end in the letter m , and the rule for choosing them or him rather than they or he is exactly the same as it is for who and whom . By playing around with the sentence you plan to write , substituting he or him for who or whom you can get a pointer that tells you which of the two words will be correct . Of course , that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can try answering the question as simply as possible to get your pointer . <p> Question : Who / Whom is knocking on the door ? Answer : He is knocking . <p> So now we know that the right word to use in the question is who . <p> I met three men , one of who / whom is an astronaut . I met three men , one of them is an astronaut . <p> In this case , whom matches them and would be the correct word to use . <p> Unfortunately , our little cheat does n't  always work as easily as it does in the above examples . If you find yourself struggling , you 'll have to return to your verb so you can decide whether who / whom is the subject or object of the verb . Always remember a subject performs the action indicated by the verb while the object is on the receiving end . <p> You can also look at where your prepositions are located . Whom often follows a preposition . For example : <p> With whom <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom <h> Still worried ? <p> Remember , the subtleties which dictate when we use who and when we use whom are not clear to the majority of people . Unless you are writing a formal document , you can choose who and hope for the best . But if you can master the who / whom distinction , you 'll be ahead of the pack , and that 's always a great place to be . <h> 8 comments <p> Thank you for this explanation . I 'm not sure I totally get when to use whom instead of who , but I understand better than I did before . I always get confused when I have to make the decision of which one is correct to use . I think it would be better if we just all started to use " who " <p> This is one mistake I have seen loads of people make on a daily basis . English might not be an easy language to learn and I must agree that the mistake is made mostly by people who use it as a second language . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a native speaker . <p> There are plenty of native English speakers who do n't  use who and whom correctly . In my experience , more so than second language learners . Native speakers think they know even though they do n't  and use the two in the incorrect way . Second language speakers just avoid using whom because they know they do n't  know how to use it correctly . <p> This definitely helps to clear up the confusion between who and whom for me . We all have moments where we struggle with grammar and certain words . Who and whom are two that confuse me every time I need to decide between the two . 
@@12747273 @1347273/ <h> Please , Do n't  Ask a Writer to <p> Plenty of people ask writers for all kinds of favors and connections . While its sometimes flattering to be asked , the constant deluge of requests creates problems for writers . Even lesser-known writers receive many requests to do things they just do n't  have the time or inclination to do . There are a lot of people out there who think writers are fair game for all kinds of crazy requests . <p> Partly this over-familiarity is because writers seem so accessible . Their pictures and names are on their books , often with a little blurb about their life . They have a website where they may talk about some personal things or invite fans to comment . There 's also an element of " He made it , he should help me get a leg up in this business .

First , it just takes a lot of time . If we read everything were asked to read , we 'd never get our own work ( which pays the bills ) done . Second , if we criticize your work you 're going to hate us and then feel free to tell everyone on the internet what a complete asshat we were for criticizing you . If we tell you its great , you 're going to demand numbers 2 , 4 , and 8 , below , taking even more of our time . Third , there may be legal reasons why we cant read your work . We do n't  want you suing us when something we write is ever so vaguely similar to your magnum opus . There are plenty of writers groups and workshops where you can find people to read your work . <h> Give you the name and number of our agent or publisher <p> If we do this without reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk angering our agents and publishers by having people submit crummy work under our referral . This is not a way to further our own career and is , in fact , a quick path to getting dumped by an agent or editor . To put you in contact with our agent/publisher would involve reading your work to make sure its not crap and you can see in number one , above , why you should n't ask that , either . <h> Teach you how to write <p> There are plenty of classes and books to teach you how to write and most will do a far better job of it . What works for one writer may not work for you so you might as well learn on a " neutral field , " so to speak , rather than getting the specifics of what works for one person . <h> Ask for reviews or book blurbs <p> Some writing advice books trot this one out as a way to get " name brand " reviews for your work . You should just send your work to random writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of us do n't  have the time , inclination , or legal freedom to read your work . There are only two exceptions to this rule : First , you can ask if you have some personal relationship to the writer . ( For example , he was in your writing group , you took a class together , met at a conference , or your agent(s) introduced you . ) Second , if the writer invites submissions on their website . Some writers are also reviewers and will invite other writers to submit items for potential review . Most wont promise that yours will be chosen , though . <h> Ask us to work for free <p> It probably seems like writing is n't much of a job so you probably feel no shame in asking us to write the copy for your brothers website , or that article for the alumni magazine , and not offering us any compensation . Its even worse if another professional or a corporation asks for a freebie . " Hey , if you could just write a few lines for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ! " The thing is , writing is work . It is a skill that should be compensated , just like any other skill . There are times when writers may work for free , but those are carefully chosen volunteer opportunities or chances to advance our careers . No matter how little time you think the job will require , trust us , it will take a lot longer and that 's more of our time down the drain . If you ask a writer to do something for you , at least offer to pay . If the writer says , " No problem , I 'll do it for free or just for the credit , " then great . But at least offer . <h> Ask us to help with a school assignment <p> Teachers often send kids out to find and interview a writer . These requests usually come under the guise of " Find someone who has the job you want , " or " Find an expert on something and interview them . " Since most writers are on the internet , were crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to little kids , if we spent time answering every kids questions we 'd never finish anything . There are plenty of books and websites devoted to the craft of writing , specific writing types , employment opportunities for writers , and so on . There 's no need to find a specific writer to answer these questions . Any website can provide the same generalities that youd get in response to an assignment . Now , if you 're friends with the writer you might be able to get away with this , but just blindly emailing every writer with a web presence is annoying . <h> Ask us to help you get a job <p> If we 've worked with you before we might be willing to act as a personal reference should you survive the initial screening process for an advertised job . Most of us are not willing to call our publisher and ask if you can have an internship , or to ask our editor at the newspaper to give you your own column . We do n't  know what kind of employee you are and were not willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonehead . <h> Ask us how to get published <p> There are plenty of books and websites dedicated to just this subject . You 're better off reading these and following industry standards than asking a writer how they did it . They may have " known someone " or done something unconventional that worked for them but which would fail miserably for you . <h> Ask us to edit or " polish " your work <p> Along with the pitfalls that come along with reading your work ( see number 1 , above ) , editing is its own special form of hell . Most of us do n't  even like to edit our own work , let alone that of others . If you need an editor , by all means hire one , but do n't  ask a writer to edit your work . You might as well be asking us to endure a root canal . <p> When a writer says , " No , " to these requests , people say they 're mean or cruel or just want to keep newbies out of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simple : Writers need to write ( and occasionally promote their own work ) to make a living . They can not do that if they are reading unsolicited manuscripts , looking for jobs for their cousins kids , or writing the neighborhood newsletter . Most writers have adopted a policy of saying , " No , " out of necessity . We do n't  enjoy being the bad guy , but its fairer to say no to everyone than to pick and choose and then be accused of favoritism . <p> Writers are professionals and deserve to be treated as such . Just as you would n't ask your doctor for a freebie or ask your own boss for a job for your shiftless brother-in-law , you should n't ask writers ( especially writers that you do n't  even know ) for freebies and favors. <h> 12 comments <p> I hate that people think writers have all the time in the world to read their writing .

If it does n't  like the word you used , it points it out to you , and in a couple of clicks , its all fixed up . But just how much can we trust spell checkers ? Speaking from experience , not very much ! Sure , its handy when you 've just made a little typo , but it has fatal drawbacks that can see you submitting work with confidence only for it to be ripped apart by your reader or teacher . Here are 10 reasons why careful proofreading is the only solution if you want to submit correct work . <h> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean different things and are spelled differently , but do n't  mean the same thing .

Of course , you could possibly sing while you sin , but it would be unusual . <h> Your Grammar Could Be Awful <p> Although spell check will occasionally pick up grammatical errors , it generally does n't  , and some of the things it thinks are wrong are actually right . For example , Microsoft Word does n't  like " your " in the sentence to follow . It suggests " you 're , but it is mistaken : <p> " Youre incomplete or tangled sentences get the green light from spell check , but later on , they make you cringe with embarrassment . If only you 'd done a more careful proofread instead of trusting spell check ! " <p> " Youre , " oh dear !

Now that I know I often tangle my fingers over the word , I know I have to check it carefully . <h> You Begin to Depend on It <p> Right clicking for spelling suggestions when you 're stumped as to why the word keeps coming up as being misspelled makes you super-lazy . Always try to correct words without spell checks help to begin with , and if you still cant get it right , see what spell check suggests . I keep a list of words I struggle to spell so that I can learn from it . It really has helped me to improve my spelling ! <h> You Wont Be Able to Write Quickly When You Need To <p> Pictures this : you 're in a skype interview with someone you hope to impress .

Make too many spelling errors , and you end up looking like a hopeless incompetent . Impressive ? Hardly ! <h> It Does n't  Know Your Terminology <p> Terminology lurks in every field , and accepted spellings do n't  always agree with spell check . For example , most people these days refer to " startups " but Microsofts spell checker has only recently caught on to the term . A few months ago , it suggested " start-ups " as the right spelling . Medical terminology and other scientific jargon often does n't  feature , and pitfalls lurk behind every terminology-laden sentence . <h> It Has No Idea What You Really Mean <p> Writing conveys meaning , but spell check has no notion of meaning . You can say " infection " instead of " affection " and have your writing end up looking kind of scary . Or you can emulate my friend and sign off your covering letter with a cheery " Kind retards . " Only you can know what you actually meant , so do n't  trust your software too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a Space <p> As long as both words are real words on their own , spell check acts dumb .

The opposite of that word , " uncouth " was used to describe a foreign or unknown person , usually with habits that were unfamiliar to the couth . Now , most of us are n't  comfortable with foreign habits and mores , and the meaning of the word " uncouth " began to morph into a term for those with bad manners . Meanwhile " couth " gradually fell out of common usage , became archaic , and was forgotten altogether . <h> Uncouth and a Joke <p> By the time people got around to writing full English dictionaries , only one word remained , " uncouth .

It could even be that people looking for an impressive-sounding word for " good manners " decided that " couth " was the logical opposite of " uncouth .

Whether as a joke or not , the word " couth " began to be used more and more in its new context .

Who is right ? <h> So , Is Couth a Real Word ? <p> " Couth " is becoming more accepted as an English word , but it is n't universally accepted at this time . It is by no means the only English word to be formed from a mistaken assumption .

Today , its 100% acceptable as a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our couth . Its still a little bit on the new side of acceptable . <h> Will Couth Become a Real Word ? <p> We do n't  know .

" Who will decide ? The popular vote of course . How do we vote for a word ? By using it when we speak and write . For now , I would recommend using " couth " in its humorous context only and not including it in any formal essays or reports , at least for the present . After all , you would n't want to end up in a heated argument with a teacher who subscribes to the idea that " couth " just does n't  cut it as a word , and that it was uncouth , or at least ignorant , of you to include it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if you want to be a writer ? Stephen King answers with a simple formula : read and write a lot . He has no patience for those people who say they want to be writers but also complain they do n't  have enough time to read . Voracious reading is a must if you want to be a good writer . <p> Then if you read enough , a really magic moment will always occur to those who want to become a writer . At some point , you 'll be reading a book , you 'll put it down , and you 'll say to yourself , " This really sucks . I can do better than this . And this guy got published . " <p> See for yourself and enjoy : <p> Here are ten additional writing tips from Stephen King <h> Write a Great Opening Line <p> The very first sentence your story begins with should intrigue your reader . Stephen King says it should make your reader think , " I want to know more about this ! " I could n't agree more . Ive read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab your interest , but the best ones have been page-turners from that opening paragraph . <h> Write for Yourself First , Then Think About Your Audience <p> What would you love to read ? If you can write something that would please you , then your story will attract people with similar tastes , and even those with different tastes who would like to experience something different . By writing something youd love , you 're more genuine and more engaged , and that appeals to the reader far more than something written without passion . <h> Do n't  Obsess About Perfect Grammar <p> Tell the story first , then redraft it , polishing up the grammar as you go . If you 're going to sit there pondering the " right " way to say something before the idea is fully formed , you may end up saying nothing at all . <h> Be Unafraid <p> Stephen is convinced that timidity is the writers greatest enemy . Do n't  worry about what your reader will think . Do n't  worry because you 're doing something different from the norm . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop Reading <p> As mentioned at the top of this article , he believes if you do n't  read , you ca n't be a writer . The more you read , the more you become inspired . You wont copy other authors . Instead , you 'll use your own voice . Stephen does n't  mince his words . According to him , those who do n't  have time to read , do n't  have time to write either . <h> Quit Watching TV <p> Stephen maintains that the TV is a writers greatest enemy . Although its pretty obvious that having the TV on while you 're actually writing is a bad idea , he says it saps your powers even if you watch TV at other times . Perhaps its because watching TV is a passive activity that leads little to the imagination . What do you think ? <h> Three Months Should Be Enough Time to Produce a Decent Book <p> Although some authors sweat over their novels for years at a stretch , Stephen King says a season should be long enough to get a book written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or it is n't going to happen . " <h> Shut Out Distractions <p> Do n't  answer your phone when you are writing . Do n't  have your social media notifications on . Ask your family to leave you alone except if a matter of life or death were to arise . Concentrate on what you are doing to the exclusion of everything else . Create yourself a quiet writing space . Even the radio playing in the background will distract you from your work . <h> Write as You <p> No matter how much you admire the style of other writers , trying to use their style is a recipe for disaster . Develop your own style and be unique . Copy someone else , and be nothing but a shadowy imitation of something that is truly good . <h> Take a Rest and Reread <p> Stephen says that a six-week rest followed by a reread of your book will prove enlightening . Distance yourself from your work , and then read it impartially . Your final edits will fall into place naturally . <p> Learning from other peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful as King offers you the benefit of his knowledge , ignoring it is just plain silly . It makes sense to take Stephen Kings writing advice to heart . <p> Vague numbers like tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands and tens of millions are not scientific . They can be used as a sheer exaggeration , or they could reflect a vague number that 's based on fact . Of course , you could always ask people to clarify what they really mean , or look up the real facts for yourself , but here are a few guidelines when you do use or come across numbers like this . <h> Exaggeration <p> When it comes to exaggeration , anything goes as long as the number is far from representing any reality . Its usually fairly obvious when someone is doing this because what they are saying is frankly impossible , or at least , unlikely . What they really mean is " a lot . " Although " thousands " and " millions " are more frequently used in exaggeration than " tens of thousands " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting creative when indulging in the art of exaggeration ! <h> Vague Real Numbers <p> Look carefully at the phrase " tens of thousands . " The word " tens " is pluralized , so just 10,000 would be too few . You need several sets of ten to make up " tens . " We have now successfully eliminated all numbers from 10,000 to 19,999 . As soon as we hit the 20,000 mark , we now have more than one set of ten , so we can use the plural form . This holds true all the way up to 99,999 , although , by the time you get to the upper limit " almost a hundred thousand , " though still vague , gives a better indication of just how big the numbers are . <h> Vague Hundreds of Thousands <p> Now that we 've looked at " tens of thousands , " you could probably write this paragraph for me , but in case I lost you first time round , let 's take it from the top . " Hundreds " means more than one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of anything without exaggerating until you get to the two hundred thousand level . You can carry on talking about hundreds of thousands until the number under discussion reaches one million , but most people would point out that anything over 900,000 is getting close to a million . <h> Why Be Vague About Numbers ? <p> There are actually several reasons to be unclear about numbers : <p> You do n't  know what the number is , and you 're guessing . <p> You have some idea of the number , but there could be more or less than that . <p> You 're using these expressions for effect and know you may be exaggerating . <p> You are n't  exaggerating , but you either do n't  have , or couldnt be bothered with , exact numbers . <p> The exact numbers are n't  really important . <h> How About Some Examples ? <p> People have been making fires using this method for hundreds of thousands of years . <p> Modern humans are said to have evolved about 200,000 years ago , so its not incorrect to use " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is n't really important . What you are saying is that people have used a certain method to make fires for a very , very long time . <p> Again , the exact number really is n't an issue in this statement . I just want people to know that they can write a lot of words using a simple challenge . If the person is interested in knowing more after reading this statement , they can look to see the exact number is 66,795 words . <p> There must be hundreds of thousands of bacteria living on that decaying food ! <p> here 's a statement that 's sheer guesswork . You have absolutely no idea how many bacteria are living on the food , but by the look of it , there must be plenty . <p> Judging from the poll , there are tens of thousands of people who agree with me . <p> There was a number . It was big . You cant really remember it , and you ca n't be bothered to get the exact figure . Was it 30,000 , or was it 50,000 ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of grains of salt should you take vague number statements ? <p> To put it differently , can you take people seriously when they use vague numbers ? I think the best bet is to believe that they mean " a lot " and judging by the context , you should be able to get some idea of whether their " tens " or " hundreds " of thousands really do fall into the numerical range suggested by the phrases . <p> All the same , you cant take numbers like that too seriously . They 're just too broad , and they can too easily be used to make exaggerated claims . When in doubt , find out . That 's what Google is for . <p> Proverbs are commonly used expressions that illustrate a specific point . They differ from idioms because idioms do n't  always make literal sense , but if you have a context , you can usually work out what a proverb means . Here are a few examples of idioms : <p> I passed the exam by the skin of my teeth . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubs me up the wrong way . <p> If we were to look at these literally , they 're just nonsensical . Since they are often used , however , most people will know what they mean even though they do n't  have any skin on their teeth , havent been fed lately , and did n't  get a massage from a clumsy person . <p> Proverbs , on the other hand , do make a weird sort of sense , especially when you have the context of the situation . <p> My mom was always against beatings , but my father would say : " Spare the rod and spoil the child . " <p> You really made a fool of yourself , but there 's no use crying over spilled milk . <p> Do n't  just invest in that business because it sounds nice . Check out their financials ; you need to look before you leap . <p> I searched and searched through my overstuffed closet , but finding my best tie was like trying to find a needle in a haystack . <p> After he was rude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs do n't  make a right . <p> In our first example , the fictional father is taking words straight out of the book of Proverbs in the bible . You can see that the discussion is about beatings or corporeal punishment . You might use a rod to beat someone , and if a child is spoiled through lack of discipline , he or she will always insist on getting their own way . Whether you agree with beating naughty kids or not , you can see what the proverb means . <p> Our other examples are non-biblical , but they are so old , and so well used , that finding their origins would be difficult . <p> " Crying over spilled milk " means regretting something that has already happened and ca n't be undone . " Looking before you leap " means getting all the facts before you commit yourself . And although the guy who ca n't find his best tie is n't literally " looking for a needle in a haystack , " we can see that he thinks the task is as difficult . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a right , " is really easy to understand . If I were to hit someone because they were rude to me , I might have a reason for my action , but it still would n't be right . <p> You can get whole dictionaries full of proverbs , but some are more commonly used than others . Here are a few examples with their meanings : <p> I was n't sure how to behave in the high-class gathering , so I thought : " When in Rome , do as the Romans do , " and just followed their example . <p> This proverb means behaving as everybody else does , and some people even abbreviate it to " When in Rome " because its so commonly used . <p> I was going to argue with the shop manager after he treated me so badly , but the pen is mightier than the sword , so I wrote a bad review on Yelp instead . <p> Written arguments are often stronger than spoken ones , or even using violence . <p> You really ought to ask for help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An island is all alone , surrounded by water , but people are surrounded by other people , and we can influence or help each other . <p> How can you call others lazy when you are so lazy yourself ? People who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones . <p> Do n't  always point out your own faults in others . You have the same faults , and if someone were to mention them , you would have no defense . <p> Ive been waiting for this letter for weeks ! Still , better late than never ! <p> Something that should have happened earlier took a long time , but at least it happened eventually . <p> You and I have a lot in common . Let 's be friends ! Birds of a feather flock together . <p> People who are similar to each other often get along very well . They hang out with each other in the same way that birds of the same species often like to congregate . <p> I could write a book about my holiday , but instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints a thousand words . <p> Sometimes , pictures are even more expressive than any words that could be said . You can get the whole idea just by looking at it , instead of having to read a lot of text . <p> When they released the new PlayStation , I was waiting outside the shop before it opened . The early bird catches the worm . <p> If you 're quick to go in search of what you want , your chances of success are greater . But was the worm also early ? Perhaps he was just coming back from last nights party . <p> Proverbs can be very cliched because they are used a lot , but they do come in handy at times when you 're looking for a good way to say something and want a phrase that everyone will identify with because it reflects accepted wisdom . <p> Before we show how to identify passive voice , let 's dispel a few myths that make yours truly turn into a hairy , clawed monster every time they 're repeated . I 'm willing to sacrifice the monster coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehoods . <h> Passive Voice Is Incorrect <p> This is the worst one , and the thought that many believe this is already turning me into a werewolf . No , no , no , and absolutely no ! Using passive voice is not wrong . There are even times when its absolutely necessary . <h> When You See a Form Of " To Be , " Its Passive Voice <h> Grammar Checkers Find Passive Voice <p> No , they cant . Grammar checkers are dicey . They can help , but they can also be a real pain in parts of the anatomy I will not mention here . The fact is , they 're quite capable of missing passive voice , and they 're quite capable of missing real grammatical errors , or identifying correct sentences as being incorrect . There are no short cuts . Its important to actually learn your grammar . <h> What 's Passive Voice ? <p> Passive reverses the position of the subject ( the doer ) and the object ( the thing that is acted on ) . Confused ? An example makes it clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's passive voice . <p> " The professor passed the paper . " That 's active voice . <p> In the second sentence , you have a normal structure of a subject ( professor ) doing something active ( passing ) to an object ( paper ) . The first sentence makes the paper into the subject and does not emphasize the verb or who committed the act . <p> How do we know which is which ? In passive voice , the doer comes after the thing that was done . Also , you can look for forms of " to be " followed by a past participle . In our example , " was " is a form of " to be " and the past participle is " passed . " <p> Forms of " to be " are : was , is , am , are , have been , has , will be , being , and will have been . <p> Am I contradicting my statement that " to be " ( and its forms ) does not always indicate passive voice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " I know how it feels to be a werewolf . " <p> That 's active voice . There is no past participle . The subject , " I , " comes first . " I know how it feels to be confused , " is also active voice because the subject " I " comes before the thing that happened . Further , " confused " is an adjective that describes a feeling or state . <h> Is There an Easy Way to Identify Passive Voice ? <p> Yes , and its really simple . To identify passive voice , look at what happened and look at who was responsible for doing it . If the person or thing responsible for doing the actions is either omitted or occurs in the sentence AFTER the thing that happened , AND if you see a past participle straight after the form of " to be , " its passive voice . <p> " Poland was invaded . " Passive voice the doer is absent . <p> " Poland was invaded by Germany . " That 's passive voice . The doer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany invaded Poland . " That 's active voice . The doer comes first . <h> Why Do People Believe Passive Voice Is Bad ? <p> Although the passive voice is perfectly correct and sometimes even preferable , it may be a trifle vague especially when doers are omitted . So looking at our World War 2 example , Poland was invaded . Who did it ? The second passive voice example gives all the facts , but the third example is the most lucid and concise . It uses three words whereas the second passive voice version needs five . Active voice sentences are often shorter , clearer and easier to understand . <h> When Is the Passive Voice the Best Way to Say Things ? <p> Passive voice is preferable when : <p> Nobody knows who was responsible : " A fire was started . " <p> Nobody cares who was responsible : " Shrubs were planted . " <p> You do n't  know , you do n't  care , but you know it happened , so you 're being deliberately vague : " The law was passed in 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who or what does it : " Rules were made to be broken . " <p> The thing that was acted on is more important than what caused it to happen : " The road was built in 100 AD . " <p> You are writing in a genre that generally requires the passive voice . This often applies to scientific papers , usually in the " materials and methods " section : " 100 plants were subjected to CO2 enrichment . " <p> When you use the passive voice , be sure that its the best way to say what you want to say . Beware of omitting important facts since passive voice allows you to do so without a grammatical error . Also , beware of turning an easy statement into an awkward one by making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be . <p> As you may have noticed , I love " it depends " questions because then we can look at a question from every possible angle . Quite a lot of what 's about to follow is personal opinion , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . After all , it just makes it all the more interesting for everyone . The choice between writing a letter and typing a letter is influenced by the reason for writing , so well look at business letters and friendly letters and argue the pros and cons of writing or typing under these categories . <h> Write or Type Business Letters <p> If you want to be taken seriously in this day and age , you would certainly choose to type rather than write when sending a business letter . The only part of a business letter you should write by hand is the signature . Here are some of the reasons its appropriate to type rather than write a business letter . <p> Your handwriting may not be all that easy to read . <p> You cant as easily make changes to a handwritten business letter , so even if you draft it several times , you may not express yourself as well when you write by hand . <p> A typed letter looks neater and more professional , no matter how neat your handwriting is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I spelled " embarrassment " correctly the first time ! Can you ? <p> In the business world , handwritten letters are extremely rare , but there is one place other than the signature where I feel handwriting offers a special touch . If you 're thanking someone with a brief note , the kind that gets written on compliments slips or greeting cards , then I think writing by hand is more personal . <h> Write or Type Personal Letters <p> There 's still something lovely about getting a letter via " snail mail . " Should you write it or type it ? I doubt whether anyone would be offended by a typed letter , and it has the advantages of being easier to write , easier to edit , and easier to read . <p> Still , a handwritten letter is a labor of love and provided its legible and well thought out . I think most people would acknowledge that you went to extra effort on their behalf with a handwritten personal letter . What 's more , any errors that sneak in will be forgiven because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They like you , even love you , and its probably not for your skill at spelling . <p> Before you decide to give a personal letter a special touch by writing it with old-fashioned pen and paper , know what you 're letting yourself in for . <p> You need to plan ahead by creating a rough framework so that your thoughts flow logically . <p> Youll have to write at least two versions and possibly more . <p> You need to be able to write neatly so that its easily readable . <p> You need the right equipment . <p> Choose attractive note paper , and if you struggle to keep your lines straight on paper without lines , choose paper with ruled lines . Another option is to use slightly transparent paper that will let you see a sheet with ruled lines when you place it beneath the page you are working with . Choose a pen with ink that wo n't easily smudge , and pick a dark colored ink . Gold may look pretty , but it is n't easy to read a full letter written in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Typed Personal Letters <p> One thing you should remember about handwritten letters is that you 'll get less text on each page . If you have a lot to say in your letter , typing is probably a better solution . You do n't  want to end up trying to cram a ten-page missive into an envelope . <p> If you 're planning to write to several people , you can " cheat " just a little bit . Its easy to adapt the introductory and closing paragraphs with personal messages for each recipient while the body text remains the same , or nearly the same , for all the letters you 're going to send . <p> Last but not least , if your letter gets lost in the post , you 'll have a copy saved on your computer and wont have to rewrite your letter from scratch . <h> Whens the Last Time You Sent a Handwritten Letter ? <p> Handwritten letters are quite rare these days . I think that their rarity makes them rather special . If I were to write a love letter , I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> That 's right , this specially compiled article is especially for those who struggle with the difference between the words " specially " and " especially . " But how did this confusion arise to begin with ? I suspect the trouble started when people began to use " specially " as an abbreviated form of " especially . " Although some sources say the two words are interchangeable , the really reputable ones say they mean two completely different things and are only interchangeable in certain contexts . <h> What do these words have in common ? <p> Both of them are adverbs ( words that are used to describe a verb ) . Both of them can mean a thing was done for a particular purpose . For example , " I got this ( e ) specially for you ! " <p> In this context , those who say either word means the same thing are spot on . However , I would venture to say " specially " would be the more common form in this context . <h> How do they differ ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly or " above all . " Let 's watch it in action : <p> " She adores flowers , especially roses . " <p> " He hates work , especially hard physical labor . " <p> If you were to replace " especially " with " specially " here , you would have sentences that people can understand , but your word choice would be considered colloquial at best . <p> Now let 's try the same exercise with " specially . " This word refers to a specific purpose for which something was done , and yes , its just like our very first example , where we demonstrated that " especially " and " specially " are interchangeable in certain contexts . Now you can play fast and loose and switch these two words around as you please . But remember , when the word you are looking for means " particularly " or " above all " ONLY " especially " will do . <p> " The furniture was ( e ) specially designed for my living room . " <p> " He bought the reddest rose ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use <p> Think of the word " particularly . " If you can replace the " special/especial " with " particularly , " then only " especially " is absolutely correct . Let 's look at one of our earlier examples : <p> " She loves flowers , especially roses . " <p> " She loves flowers , particularly roses . " <p> Does it work ? Yes , it does ! So " especially " is the right choice , while " specially " would be incorrect . <p> You 'll notice that trying to jam " particularly " into a " for a special purpose " meaning does n't  sit quite as comfortably . <p> " He bought the reddest rose particularly for her . " <p> Does it work ? Not particularly ! Now we know we can use whichever of the two words we prefer . Do n't  you love freedom ? If you 're in doubt , stick with " especially " since it works in both contexts . You cant go wrong ! <h> How important is it ? <p> " Not specially . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right : the first one , or the second one ? If you guessed that the second version is correct , you really do know the difference between these two words already . Congratulations ! <h> Can you be sure ? <p> " Not particularly , " works well in this context , so you can be sure that you are 100% correct . <p> But returning to our question " How important is it ? " what do you think the answer is ? I 'd say that if you 're using language simply to be understood , it is n't especially important because people would probably understand you even if you used " specially " in the wrong place . However , in written English , we have to be especially ( particularly ) careful about word choices , and picking the wrong one would make your teacher , or an especially ( particularly ) well-informed reader , upset at the wording . <p> Its common for people to wonder , " What does it mean to put an apostrophe after an S ? " It can get a bit confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a possessive is . <p> Possessives are used to show ownership ; to show that something belongs to someone . " The presidents official airplane " is one example . The airplane belongs to the president , of course . But there is only one president ; after all , you do n't  have two presidents of the same country . So , this is a singular possessive made by adding an apostrophe and an " s . " <p> But with a phrase such as " the thieves jewels , " you have a plural noun : thieves . Most of the time , a plural noun will be formed by adding " s " to it . In this case , you also change the spelling but do n't  worry about that now . The main issue is the final letter , which is " s . " Houses , cats , clouds , essays , rainbows : these are all plural nouns . <p> As you can see , the fact that the thieves ( illegally ) possess the jewels is shown simply by adding an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They may not possess these valuables for long unless they 're clever and know how to escape the police , but they do for now . And that 's how you form a plural possessive . <p> To recap , usually if the noun is singular , the apostrophe will go before the s , but if the noun happens to be plural , the apostrophe will go after the s . <h> Plural Possessive Examples <p> The Simpsons spaceship ( the spaceship belongs to the Simpson family ; you make the family name plural to show that you 're referring to all of the family members ) <p> The dogs tails ( the tails belong to the dogs ) <p> The lakes water ( the water belongs to the lakes ) <p> You have to be careful with the last example because if you only wish to talk about one lake , you must write : " the lakes water . " In this case , that 's a singular possessive . <p> An even bigger problem these days is when people write sentences such as this : " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reason to use an apostrophe to make a possessive here . The sentence is only talking about monkeys in the plural . They do not own anything ! However , this is a commonly repeated mistake across the Internet . <p> Sometimes its hard to see how the possessive works . " You owe me three months pay immediately ! " Oh , I do ? Let me check my wallet . And my grammar guide . Why is there an apostrophe after " months ? " Because the pay is equal to three months of work . In a sense , the pay belongs to those three months . Its like saying " three months of pay . " If you can use the word " of " in the sentence , then you probably need an apostrophe . <h> Irregular Plural Possessives <p> Now that you think you 've learned all the rules , you 're in for a surprise . There 's another type of plural possessive : the irregular plural possessive . The childrens work was so poorly done that the teacher fainted and had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , but I used to be a teacher , and sometimes I felt like fainting ! <p> The main point is this . " Children " is already plural . You can not add " s " to the word itself to make it plural . So when you want to show possession , you put the apostrophe first , then the " s . " Here are some more examples . <p> The womens babies ( " women " is the plural form of " woman " ) <p> The firemens trucks ( " firemen " is the plural of " fireman " ) <p> The dices roll ( " dice " always means there is more than one ) <p> These look like singular possessives , but they are n't  . <h> Compound Plural Possessives <p> You may have thought we had exhausted all of the plural possessives , but there 's one more rule you need to know . It deals with compound plural possessives . For example , " Sam and Dave " is a compound . There are two parts . So which of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one for six months . <p> Sams and Daves song was number one for six months . <p> The correct one is the first . Why ? Because Sam and Dave made or performed the song together . It belongs to both of them . Only one possessive needs to be given . But you need to be careful . <p> Lucys and Ginas cars are the fastest on my street . <p> Micks and Rods views on equal rights are impressive . <p> In these two examples , you need two possessives , one for each proper noun . Lucy and Gina both have different cars . Mick and Rod have separate views . However , what if Lucy and Gina were mother and daughter , and both of them had the same cars ? Then you need to change the sentence to " Lucy and Ginas cars are the fastest on my street . " <p> With compound plural possessives , its important to remember you have to think a little and decide whether you are talking about two separate people or things , or a single unit with two parts .

The more you write , the faster you 'll improve and the more you 'll grow as a writer . <h> Master revision and editing <p> The freedom of writing first drafts is fun but the work is n't finished until its been revised and polished . You can not be a good writer unless you master revision and learn how to edit your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud you see mistakes that your eyes just glanced over . You also hear if your dialogue sounds real or stilted , or if your work flows smoothly from sentence to sentence and topic to topic . <h> Learn the rules <p> Some writers claim that their work is " groundbreaking " and that they do n't  have to follow the rules , much less bother to learn them . The most successful rule breakers are the writers who first learned the rules and then learned how to break them for effect .

Use an old-fashioned dictionary and thesaurus and learn how to edit your own work . <h> Rewrite old work <p> Take an old piece and rewrite it . Not only is this practice , it gives you the chance to see how you 've improved since you first wrote the piece . <h> Rewrite the work of other writers <p> You do n't  want to do this for publication because you 're teetering close to plagiarism . However , rewriting good work let 's you deconstruct the sentences and construction so you can better see how it all works together .

When looking for events to attend , look closely at which ones will offer you the most benefit before you spend your money . <h> Outline <p> You do n't  have to outline like you did in school with Roman numerals and headings , but it can be helpful to organize your thoughts before you begin to write . This may be as simple as writing , " This happens , then this , then that , " on a sheet of paper , or you might want to write some scenes or topics on index cards and fit them in the correct order before you begin . A little organization before you begin can lead to a cleaner draft and a story that makes more sense . <h> Invest in your writing <p> There are plenty of free resources to help you improve your skills , but at some point you 're likely going to have to be willing to put forth some money . Good reference books , conference fees , and tuition all require money . Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Expand your vocabulary <p> Take the time to improve your vocabulary . The more words you know , the more tools you have to work with . Look up a new word every day or use a " Word a Day " calendar or screensaver . If you run into a word you do n't  know while you 're reading , or if a speaker uses a word you do n't  know , look it up . <h> Be informed <p> The more informed you are about your industry , world events , or writing in general , the more choices you have about what to write and how to write it . This will keep you from writing the same things over and over again . You 'll also be able to write more authoritatively . <p> Improvement is always possible .

@@12747276 @1347276/ <h> 11 Elements of a Successful Author Website <p> Having a web presence is almost mandatory for writers these days . Whether you write fiction , non-fiction or are a freelance writer , a website gives readers and clients a way to find you , interact with your work , and hire you for jobs . It also gives you a chance to reach out to people who might be encountering your work for the first time . As with any communications medium , you need to to make a great first impression and offer people reasons to come back . In addition to making sure that its free of grammatical errors and typos , here are eleven things you should consider adding to your website . <h> Contact information <p> This is the most important thing to have on your website . You want people to be able to contact you with job offers , appearance requests , and questions . If you have fans , you want to be able to interact with them . Do n't  make it hard for people to find you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Appearances/Events <p> Let your readers know where you 'll be appearing or speaking . Use this page to keep them informed of any events you 'll be attending or organizing . Let them know of any benefits for attending such as book signings , giveaways , discounted book purchases , etc . <h> Purchase information <p> If you have anything to sell , be sure to include links . You may offer the ability to purchase directly from your website ( this will require some sort of e-commerce solution ) , or provide links to Amazon or other retailers . Include the ISBN numbers of any books so stores can easily order them . Make it easy for people to buy your work . <h> A clean , consistent , professional design <p> Do n't  clutter up your site with lots of colors , fonts , animations , and images . Do n't  make every page look different . Keep it consistent . Make your navigation system easy to follow . Make the site professional-looking . Cutesy might work if you 're a childrens author , but freelancers and book writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy on the eyes and easy to navigate . Funky colors and fonts may make an artistic statement , but they can also make your readers crazy . <h> Freebies <p> People love free stuff . Maybe you give away a short story related to your current novel , or you put together a short guide to your non-fiction subject of interest . Maybe you give away some character background information or provide a playlist that captures the mood of your book . Post sample chapters or excerpts from your work so people can try before they buy . Think of something that your audience will want or find useful and give it away . People also love contests , so you might consider hosting one every now and then . <h> About/Bio/Resume <p> For non-fiction writers and freelancers , this will be similar to a traditional job resume detailing your experience and expertise in your field . For fiction writers , it will be a list of your publishing credits and anything that makes you qualified to write that particular story ( for example , your main character is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In either case , be sure to clearly describe the types of work you offer and maybe tell a bit about your personal story or how you got into writing . Just do n't  go on too long or include too much irrelevant information . You can also include some reviews/testimonials about your work . Depending on your experience and what you offer this section might be one page , or a main page with several links leading off of it . <h> Media/Press Kit <p> This makes it easier for the press to find everything they need to know about you . You can include your bio , a photo , cover images from your books , links to other interviews you 've done , and reviews of your work . These should be downloadable documents that the media can reuse them in their own materials . <h> Links to your social media platforms <p> If you 're on social media , include links to your active platforms . This is an easy and effective way to promote your writing . <h> A blog <p> A blog does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . You can post once a week , or every other week , as long as what you have to say is relevant and interesting . Use it to keep readers abreast of your progress on various projects , or answer fan questions . Post about your work process so people can emulate you if they wish . Post about recent experiences you had at events or signings . Keep it relevant , though . Too many posts about your dog or your garden ( unless you write about dogs or gardening ) will turn people off who came to learn about your work . <h> Information about upcoming projects <p> If you have books in the pipeline , give your readers a heads up about what 's coming . You may be contractually limited in what you can say , but readers always want to know what you 're working on now . Even freelance writers can let their clients know that they 're expanding into new markets or pursuing a relevant non-fiction book . <h> Resources <p> This could be a list of links to some of your research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if your work is used in classrooms ) , links to other sites or blogs on your subject matter or which you find helpful , FAQ answers , or anything else that you think your readers will find valuable . <p> Not everything on this list is necessary or applicable to every type of writer . The key is to understand who your readers/clients are and the things they 're likely to be seeking at your site . A young adult author will have a very different site from a scientific author . A freelance writers site will look different from that of a book writer . Give your readers and clients what they want from your site in a way that 's easy to navigate and understand and you 'll be on your way to success . <h> 2 comments <p> Great Tips ! Starting and keeping up a author website does n't  have to be difficult , expensive , or time consuming . If you spend an hour or two on it each day you 'll have everything running smoothly and readers stopping by your site in no time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're an author , you should think of your website like you do your writing . You do n't  want to slap it up there without any thought .

That is , your search was likely from something along the lines of " what are long tail keywords ? " rather than simply " keywords " . For those looking to drive traffic to blogs or websites , understanding how these phrases work is an important tool to generating that traffic . For this reason , its important to understand what they are and how they can be of benefit for driving traffic . <h> What are long tail keywords ? <p> Long tail keywords are those three or more keyword phrases which are specific to whatever you are writing about or selling . You see , whenever a customer uses a highly specific search phrase , they tend to be looking for exactly what they input into the search engine . In virtually every case , such very specific searches are far more likely to convert to sales or bring traffic to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searches tend to be geared more toward the type of research that consumers typically do prior to making a buying decision or when doing general research . <p> Before we begin , a basic understanding of keywords is important . Think of it in terms of the following hypothetical example . <p> Let us assume you own a shop selling SCUBA diving equipment . Customers doing a general search would type in " SCUBA " which would be your keyword . Their search engine will return results ranked according to the most relevant information . <p> However , since there are millions of references to the term " SCUBA " and with thousands of shops around the world selling SCUBA equipment and providing information about SCUBA diving , your site will be drowned out among all the noise . You would be lucky if it ranked on page 500 . <p> When it comes to driving traffic to your site , customers are usually a lot more specific . They do n't  want a million results . They may only want a few . They do n't  simply make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several specific words which are referred to as long-tail keywords . For example , a customer based in San Diego is not going to go looking for a SCUBA shop in Africa . <p> The customer will want the shop closest to him and so " SCUBA equipment in San Diego " would be a more likely search than just " SCUBA " . The browser would return information specific to that phrase , thus eliminating all the competition that 's not in the San Diego area . Remember , you 're aiming for quality over quantity . Now your website may rank on page 30 , a vast improvement but not good enough . You still need to improve your SEO ranking . <h> How do I improve my ranking ? <p> Improving your ranking is what is known as search engine optimization ( SEO ) .

Please help me . <p> I do n't  think people should worry too much about keywords or long tail keywords . If you write good content , you will get to the top of search engines .

Those who do n't  are going to have few pageviews to their blogs . <p> This is great ! Long tail keywords help make sure that you are finding exactly what you are searching for and also that if you have a website , you do n't  fall into obscurity .

Writing good content is by far the most important but let 's be honest the web is full of articles so to make your stand out you will need to make it easy to find on the web and for that reason using these keywords helps a lot . <p> Do people really search that specifically when using search engines .

Many students try to solve this problem by rewriting the essays sentences to make them wordier or splitting contractions . While these do increase word count , they usually make the essay weaker in the process . It does n't  have to be that way . If you ever find yourself in a position where you need to increase the number of words for an essay , below are some simple techniques which can help you add to your writing while improving it instead of writing unneeded filler . <h> Add Examples <p> Skim through your essay looking for any place you have used an example to make a point . In most cases , you should be able to provide additional examples which will make your essay stronger by showing your understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also go through the essay and look for statements made where inserting an example would be appropriate to help support the statement . <h> Address Different Viewpoints <p> An effective way of increasing word count and improving your essay at the same time is to address different viewpoints to your own . You have the opportunity to discuss how these alternative viewpoints differ from the conclusions you have made , and it gives you an opportunity to explain why you believe your conclusions are superior . This shows you have considered a range of different opinions while coming to your conclusions , and in doing so make your essay stronger while adding more words . <h> Clarify Statements <p> When you find the statements in your writing , if inserting an example does n't  make sense , then clarifying the statement may be appropriate . This can be achieved by inserting one or more specific statements to clarify the original one . A common way to do this is to follow the statement with , " In other words " Its important not to over-clarify statements or use this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like filler , but using it sporadically throughout your essay can increase the word count and show you perfectly understand the points you 're trying to make . <h> Find Additional Sources <p> Another way to improve your essay and increase word count is to find additional sources you have n't previously mentioned which support the statements and conclusions you have made . The more sources you have , the stronger the essay will be in most cases . Spending some time searching for additional sources to add to the essay can be a great way to add quality content to it . <h> Use Quotations <p> Chances are you already have appropriate quotations in your essay , and if that 's the case , skip over this suggestion . Adding more will likely not add to your essay . If you have n't used any , however , finding appropriate quotations from experts in the field that support your statements can be an excellent way to add words to your essay while improving it at the same time . <h> Rework Introduction and Conclusion <p> If all of the above havent enabled you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler , look to put it in your introduction and conclusion rather than the body of the essay . Most teachers give more leeway with the introduction and conclusion to be wordy than the guts of the essay . This is something you should try to avoid if at all possible ( its never good to be wordier than you have to be ) , but if you tried everything else , its better to do it in these two places than in the heart of the essay . <h> Page Count <p> If you 're writing an essay which has a minimum page count instead of a minimum word count , the above suggestions will work , but you have a bit more wiggle room as well . You can make slight adjustments to the font and font size you use through a Words per Page Counter . As long as you do n't  go overboard , this can be a relatively easy way to increase page count while not taking away from the essay .

@@12747282 @1347282/ <h> Year : 2016 <p> You have decided you want to write a book in the next year . That 's great , but now you need to come up with a plan to make that happen that 's simple enough to help you reach the goal , yet allows you to write enough to complete a book within a year . One easy and effective way to accomplish the book-in-a-year goal is to take the 365-day book writing challenge . <p> The concept of this challenge is simple enough that any writer , no matter what their level , should be able to follow it to reach their goal . Most people who decide they want to write a book fail because they try to do too much in too little amount of time . This challenge leverages the fact there are 365 days in a year and that you want to build a daily writing habit . <p> The book writing challenge works in the following way . Once you decide to begin , each day you need to write between one and 365 words . You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the highest number off the chart , but as long as you write any number of words which corresponds with a number that 's still available on the chart , you 're golden . At the end of the day , you place an " x " on the chart over the number of words you wrote that day . Each day you do this for the entire year and at the end , you will have written 66,795 words . Even more importantly , you 'll have established a daily writing habit which you can then use to write your next book in even less time . <h> 365 Day Book Writing Challenge ( click on image to print PDF ) <p> To be successful in this challenge , there are a few important steps you should take . First , you should print out the challenge sheet . Once done , you should put it somewhere where you 'll see it daily . Tape it to the top of your laptop computer or hang it on the bulletin board above your writing desk . The chart needs to be visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if its only a little bit . This visual reminder will help you reach your daily goal of writing and the ultimate goal of finishing your book . <p> The second rule is you are n't  allowed to go to bed until you have crossed off one of the numbers on the sheet . There really is no excuse not to cross off one of the numbers . The truth is that if you are unable to cross off a number each day of the year with all of the smaller word counts available , you 're not serious about writing the book . In a way , its a test to determine if you are willing to take the actions necessary to write the book , or if you just say you want to , but its only words . That may sound a bit harsh , but if you cant write a few words each day- no matter what happens in life , writing the book is n't a priority in your life .

You should always shoot for the highest word count number still available on the sheet , but when a day comes when that is n't possible , crossing off a smaller number is perfectly acceptable . <p> While having a book written at the end of the year is a huge deal , the biggest benefit of this challenge is something you 'll gain that 's far more important . This challenge requires you to write every day . Even the days when you 're only able to write a word or two , you must sit down and write something .

Once you have established that habit , you have created a foundation which will allow you to write far more the following year . <p> If you have had the goal to write a book in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage you to try the 365-day book writing challenge . It has a lot of things going for it that other challenges do n't  , which increases the likelihood you 'll actually complete it and reach your goal . Best of all , at the end of the year , you 'll have a book written and you 'll have the skill-set in place to write as many more as you want to in the future . <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences in a paragraph , there 's no single answer to this question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you 'd expect . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your readers attention and get them to read what you 've written . The average person does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> " White Space " is a great way to make your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a blog post , and I want to keep the reader engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses 37 words . <p> I want to get your attention ! <p> The above paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers , for example : <p> " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves . Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long . <h> Academic Writing <p> In academic writing , paragraphs will usually consist of the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips , 2014 ) with references . Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many words per paragraph ? Its really up to you ! <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . <p> Making them too short , can look a little odd . <p> This is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader . A lot of text without " white space " is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to baffle the reader . <p> By the way , the above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't always better ? I 'm ready to bet that you do .

I wanted my work to change the world , to bring awareness to important issues , and to be " great . " That lasted until I was out of college . That 's when I realized that I had to eat , pay rent , and fill up my gas tank . High ideals went out the window in favor of any job that paid . And since I graduated in the middle of the 1990s recession , the bar was n't all that high . I took a fair amount of advertising and marketing work , shilling useless products to people who probably did n't  need them . But I got the bills paid , even if my work was n't world-changing in any way . <p> A few years out of college , I met a former friend who was still clinging to his ideals .

You may not be crafting life altering prose when you write that ad for weed killer , but you are earning money with your skills . You only become a " sellout " if you let that kind of work permanently derail your higher dreams . If you 're writing marketing brochures by day and working on your novel or Pulitzer winning article by night you have n't sold out , youve just made a realistic decision to keep your head above water and feed yourself/your family . <p> You might even find that " selling out " can be a good thing .

One job may lead to another until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic merit . ( Incidentally , some of the greatest artists in history became famous after they sold out . ) The money you earn from selling out can also be used to buy more education or better supplies which may speed you on to that ideal job . Getting yourself out there and earning money is rarely a bad thing . <p> The exception is that you should never take work which goes against your moral principles . Sometimes you have no choice but to work against your beliefs , as when your jerk of a boss demands that you work on a campaign for fur or be fired , even though you 're vehemently opposed to the fur trade . You may have to do it because you do n't  have enough money saved to tell the jerk to shove it .

Most employers wo n't care that you took " sellout " work like advertising , low budget movies , brochures , and infomercial scripts , but they may not look so favorably upon things written for certain industries or fringe causes .

I was fortunate enough to have parents that valued my presence in the household , and had no intentions of kicking me out .

However , I write during almost all my free time and someday I hope to make a living out of it . I completely agree with this article . I think if using what you 're best at ( even if its for something unimportant like the writing on the back of a cereal box ) to pay the bills is being a sellout , then a sellout is not necessarily a bad thing to be . Its simply having goals , but knowing reality . <p> I also love acting , so I made up an analogy for this that pertains to acting : If you want to get on Broadway but you do n't  have any theatre credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Broadway show . You start small , in your local area , doing regional and community work . You take classes and you go to every audition you can find .

But they 're not really selling out , because local theatres are wonderful places . So maybe its not a perfect analogy , but it works .

If you find you often miss mistakes when proofreading and cant get someone else to proofread it , there are a few steps you can take which will give you a better chance of catching your writing errors . <h> Walk Away <p> One of the best steps you can take when proofreading your own work is to take some time away from it , even if that is only for an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the reasons you should learn to not procrastinate . When you try to proofread as soon as you finish writing , you still have it in your head what you meant to say , and this can often overwrite what 's actually on the pages . Taking some time away will allow you to read your writing with " fresh eyes " and- will make it much more likely you 'll spot errors . <h> Listen to Your Text <p> If you do n't  have time to walk away for a bit of time , listen to your writing instead of reading it ( you can use the proofread tool available on wordcounter ) . Switching things up so you listen to what you wrote instead of reading it will again will make it more likely you will catch your mistakes rather than if you reread the text . <h> Print and Read <p> Another way to increase the chances of catching mistakes is to print out your writing instead of proofreading it on the computer . Trying to proofread on your computer makes it easier to miss mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . <h> Read from Bottom to Top <p> An effective way of proofreading which- forces you to look at the writing from a different perspective is to proofread from the bottom to the top . Instead of proofreading as one would normally read the writing , start at the bottom and read towards the top . It wo n't make any sense , but that 's the point . It will force you to look at the individual words written , rather than skimming over sentences . <h> Read It Out Loud <p> Another way to increase your chances of finding mistakes when proofreading is to read your writing out loud instead of silently in your mind . Reading silently increases your chances of inserting skipped words that are n't  on the paper but you meant to write . Audibly saying the words makes it much more difficult to skip over these types of mistakes . <h> Do n't  Do Everything at Once <p> When you do sit down to proofread , do n't  try to correct all the problems in a single read through . Instead , concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , concentrate on word choice for the first read through . Then concentrate on finding grammatical errors and sentence structure mistakes on the second read through . For the third reading , look specifically for spelling mistakes . Yes , this means you are going to have to read through your writing several times instead of a single time , but that will also make it much more likely you 'll find all the mistakes you may have made . <h> Use Spellcheck and GrammarCheck <p> Using a spell checker can help you spot words which have been repeated , words which have reversed letters and other common spelling mistakes , but you should never rely on it as the only proofreading you do . While a spell checker is great for its specific job , it fails at a lot of other things , especially when it comes to grammar . " There " is spelled correctly , but its still wrong if the proper word for a sentence is " their . " A grammar check can help out with these mistakes . Both are tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own , but they do n't  replace actually rereading your writing and looking for mistakes . <h> Make a Proofreading Checklist <p> You know your weaknesses better than anyone else , and you should make a checklist of these weaknesses . This will allow you to double and triple check these areas of your writing when you proofread . If you do n't  currently know your writing weaknesses , begin to pay attention to the remarks when you get assignments back so you can create the checklist . By paying special attention to the writing areas where you tend to be weakest , you 'll improve and make sure you are n't  consistently making the same writing mistakes on your papers . <h> 11 comments <p> As a student teacher , I wish more people would take the time to proofread . Its so frustrating seeing all the common mistakes that would have easily been caught if the student had just reread their work . It does n't  take much time , but it can be the difference in a whole grade on a paper . <p> Isnt there some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is n't , there should be . I want to put my writing into a website and it have it correct everything so its perfect and I do n't  get a bad grade for it . What I want is a proofreading program so I do n't  have to proofread my papers myself . <p> I 've never understood why my students do n't  proofread their work . If I see a paper that has n't  been proofread , I know the student wrote it at the last minute and did n't  have the time or energy to proofread . This almost always results in points taken off the writing . After spending all that time writing the damn paper , its just stupid not to proofread it . <p> I hate proofreading ! By the time I finish writing , I 'm sooo over the assignment I have no energy to read it again . The teachers should be happy that I managed to finish their stupid writing assignment . <p> Thank you for the free proof reader as part of word counter . I thought I proofread pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and I can see a big improvement in my writing . My teachers have even commented on it . Its much easier to catch mistakes when you hear what you wrote rather than reading it for the fifth time . For those of us who do n't  have someone to read our essays , this is a great solution ! <p> Proofreading is so important and I know that after writing a long piece the last thing I 'm in the mood for is to proof but the best is to take a break and then get right back to it . If you do n't  proofread , your scores will suffer . Its difficult to do at first , but once you get into the habit of doing it ( and find all the silly mistakes you made ) you 'll wonder how you ever did OK without doing it . 
@@12747289 @1347289/ <h> Month : January 2016 <p> When it comes to writing essays , there are two frequent issues that arise ; the word count is either too low or too high for the stated range of the essay . For those who perpetually end up with too few words , you need to figure out ways to increase your essay word count . For those who frequently find themselves with too many words on the page , there are some simple steps to take when editing to help reduce the number of words while at the same time making it a stronger piece of writing . Below are some suggestions to do this . <h> Rank Your Arguments <p> If you find you 're well above your word count maximum , the first step is to rank the points you use to substantiate your argument . By ranking the importance of the arguments you make in the essay , you can eliminate ones which are n't  as important as others , keeping the essay strong while removing large portions of writing . If you do n't  want to eliminate any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mentioning all the arguments , but not writing as much detail about those not as strong as the more important points . <h> Focus on the Main Point <p> Once you determine what the important arguments are for your essay , read through it looking for any paragraphs or sentences which fail to address your main argument(s) or topic . Its easy to accidentally go off on tangents when writing , and eliminating these tangents can help reduce word count . The more focused you can remain on your topic and arguments , the more concise your writing will be . <h> Use the Best Verb <p> This may sound obvious , but a lot of writers do n't  do this well . When writing , always use the perfect verb rather than one that 's close , but not perfect . When you use the best verb possible , it will reduce the amount of writing you do in most cases . This is due to the fact that when you use a verb that 's not quite correct , you usually need to add more words to clarify your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposing team by a lot of points . " <p> While " beat " is accurate in this case , its not the perfect verb because they not only beat the team , they beat the team by a lot . Using the better verb " trounce " in this instant will reduce the word count while still giving the same meaning as the longer sentence . <p> " They trounced the opposing team . " <h> Remove Adverbs <p> Look through your essay and see if you find any adverbs , especially adverbs which have " ly " endings . In many instances , these adverbs end up being filler words which end up being placed in the writing because its the way we talk , but the words do n't  add anything beneficial to the actual essay . Go through the essay and ask if each one is needed and remove those that are n't  . Some words you may want to look out for are ( click on image to expand to see better ) <h> Remove Adjectives <p> Much in the same way as adverbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one ( or none at all ) would suffice . Read the essay to see if all of the adjectives used are needed , and remove those which do n't  add to the meaning of the sentence being written . Some common adjectives to look for are : <p> When it comes to writing , there are some words that can be confusing as to which is the correct one to use . A good example of this confusion is further versus farther . Another common word duo many people have difficulty knowing which is correct is who and whom . <p> Very few people bother to use the word whom in spoken English , but when were writing , we want to use the correct grammar . Since we so seldom use whom , we are n't  always sure when it is the right choice , or when we should stick to the familiar who instead . <p> Most experts agree that if we are unsure , who is a safer bet . And its fine for informal writing after all whom is slowly disappearing from our language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , we do need to know when to use the mysterious whom . Put it in the wrong places , and you 'll look pompous and silly . Omit it when you should have used it , and you 'll look unprofessional if your error is picked up . <p> First of all , well look at the rule that governs the use of whom , and then , to make it easier for you , well look at a little cheat that you can use to test a sentence when you are n't  sure which of the two words belongs . <h> The rule governing the use of who and whom <p> Look at the verb in your sentence . Is who performing the action ? If so , who is the right choice to make . So who is the subject of a verb the one who is the doer ! <p> Who is there ? <p> Do you know who will attend the conference ? <p> Who threw that snowball ? <p> I got hit by a snowball and I want to know who threw it ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve probably already guessed that since you choose who when the person you 're referring to is the subject of your verb , you 'll use whom when the person becomes the object of the verb . The object is acted on by the verb rather than being the one responsible for the action . <p> With whom were you out last night ? <p> We will inform those whom we shortlist . <p> Be selective about those whom you choose as friends . <p> To whom should the invoice be sent ? <h> An easy cheat <p> Although we tend to be confused about when to use the word who and the contexts in which whom is the correct choice , were much more familiar with the words he and him and they and them . We instinctively know which of the words in these pairs fit into any sentence . <p> You will have noticed that whom , him and them all end in the letter m , and the rule for choosing them or him rather than they or he is exactly the same as it is for who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to write , substituting he or him for who or whom you can get a pointer that tells you which of the two words will be correct . Of course , that wo n't work as well for questions , but in that case , you can try answering the question as simply as possible to get your pointer . <p> Question : Who / Whom is knocking on the door ? Answer : He is knocking . <p> So now we know that the right word to use in the question is who . <p> I met three men , one of who / whom is an astronaut . I met three men , one of them is an astronaut . <p> In this case , whom matches them and would be the correct word to use . <p> Unfortunately , our little cheat does n't  always work as easily as it does in the above examples . If you find yourself struggling , you 'll have to return to your verb so you can decide whether who / whom is the subject or object of the verb . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the object is on the receiving end . <p> You can also look at where your prepositions are located . Whom often follows a preposition . For example : <p> With whom <p> Of whom <p> Beside whom <p> After whom <p> Around whom <h> Still worried ? <p> Remember , the subtleties which dictate when we use who and when we use whom are not clear to the majority of people . Unless you are writing a formal document , you can choose who and hope for the best . But if you can master the who / whom distinction , you 'll be ahead of the pack , and that 's always a great place to be . <p> There are times when English can be confusing , even to native speakers who learned the language from the cradle . One of the common areas of confusion arises when we have to choose between two words which seem to be almost the same . Learning to properly understand the different uses of different words is one aspect of improving your vocabulary . <p> For example , the question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " can be confusing . They look very similar , and their meanings are similar too . When were talking , few people would even notice the difference , but when were writing , we need to be more precise and choose our words carefully . How will we know when to use " further " and when to use " farther ? " Luckily , there 's a very simple way to work it out when you proofread your writing . Its the difference between literal distance and figurative distance . <h> Distances can be literal or figurative <p> When we refer to distance , it can be either literal or figurative . For example : <p> " How much farther will we have to drive to reach our hotel ? " <p> In this example , the person asking the question is looking for a literal distance . They want to know how many miles they will have to travel to reach their destination . " Farther " is completely correct in this context . <p> In the following example , our distance is figurative : <p> " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , the answer here ca n't be " Five miles " because we are n't  looking at a literal distance . <p> The good news is there 's a simple and useful trick to remembering the difference . To make your life easier , you can remember the correct use for " farther " by looking at the first syllable , " Far . " Now think of all the distance measurements . There are miles , kilometers , centimeters , inches and so on . Would you associate these measurements with what you are going to say ? If so , then " farther " is the word you should be choosing in order to be 100% correct . <p> Now consider " further " as being an " add-on " : <p> " You can have a further $5 . " " It will be a further year before you finish your studies . " " I was further insulted by her rude behavior on Sunday . " <p> It tells you that something extra is going to be added . <h> Interchangeability : just to make you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when to use the word " farther " rather than " further " its time to muddy the waters a little . Although you should n't use " farther " at times when " further " is the more appropriate choice , there are times when you can use " further " instead of " farther . " There are even some who advise you to choose " further " when in doubt . <p> People have been using these two words interchangeably for a long time , and in other parts of the world where English is spoken , " further " is used much more often , while few people use " farther " at all . But if you want to fit in with accepted modern American grammar , its important to remember the simple distinction between the literal distance " farther " and the figurative distance " further . " If you are writing a report or an essay , you need to choose the correct word , and the usages weve just discussed are accepted as correct in both the Chicago Manual of Style and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American grammar in which we will find that the two words are interchangeable . For instance : <p> " How much farther do you have to read ? " and " How much further do you have to read ? " would both be correct . After all , you could be asking someone how many pages they still need to read to finish the book , or you could be asking if they will have to read more books or more chapters to get the information they need . In the first example , you 're asking for a literal distance in the number of pages . In the second example , you 're asking for a figurative distance . As with so many other grammar rules , context is very important . <p> Let 's keep it simple . If reading this has made you more confused than ever , then just hold onto this thought : <p> " Farther " is a distance and " further " is something extra . How easy is that ? <p> You have decided you want to write a book in the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a plan to make that happen that 's simple enough to help you reach the goal , yet allows you to write enough to complete a book within a year . One easy and effective way to accomplish the book-in-a-year goal is to take the 365-day book writing challenge . <p> The concept of this challenge is simple enough that any writer , no matter what their level , should be able to follow it to reach their goal . Most people who decide they want to write a book fail because they try to do too much in too little amount of time . This challenge leverages the fact there are 365 days in a year and that you want to build a daily writing habit . <p> The book writing challenge works in the following way . Once you decide to begin , each day you need to write between one and 365 words . You want to shoot for writing the highest number of words you can to cross the highest number off the chart , but as long as you write any number of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart , you 're golden . At the end of the day , you place an " x " on the chart over the number of words you wrote that day . Each day you do this for the entire year and at the end , you will have written 66,795 words . Even more importantly , you 'll have established a daily writing habit which you can then use to write your next book in even less time . <h> 365 Day Book Writing Challenge ( click on image to print PDF ) <p> To be successful in this challenge , there are a few important steps you should take . First , you should print out the challenge sheet . Once done , you should put it somewhere where you 'll see it daily . Tape it to the top of your laptop computer or hang it on the bulletin board above your writing desk . The chart needs to be visible so you are reminded each day you need to write , even if its only a little bit . This visual reminder will help you reach your daily goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second rule is you are n't  allowed to go to bed until you have crossed off one of the numbers on the sheet . There really is no excuse not to cross off one of the numbers . The truth is that if you are unable to cross off a number each day of the year with all of the smaller word counts available , you 're not serious about writing the book . In a way , its a test to determine if you are willing to take the actions necessary to write the book , or if you just say you want to , but its only words . That may sound a bit harsh , but if you cant write a few words each day- no matter what happens in life , writing the book is n't a priority in your life . The only thing that can keep you from completing this challenge is yourself . <p> Another key about this challenge which increases your likelihood of success is that it takes into account the reality of life . There are going to be busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to write as much as you hoped . You should always shoot for the highest word count number still available on the sheet , but when a day comes when that is n't possible , crossing off a smaller number is perfectly acceptable . <p> While having a book written at the end of the year is a huge deal , the biggest benefit of this challenge is something you 'll gain that 's far more important . This challenge requires you to write every day . Even the days when you 're only able to write a word or two , you must sit down and write something . That daily writing will turn into a daily routine by the end of the year . Once you have established that habit , you have created a foundation which will allow you to write far more the following year . <p> If you have had the goal to write a book in the past but have failed in getting it done , I encourage you to try the 365-day book writing challenge . It has a lot of things going for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll actually complete it and reach your goal . Best of all , at the end of the year , you 'll have a book written and you 'll have the skill-set in place to write as many more as you want to in the future . <p> As a writer , you may find yourself pondering the question , " How many words are in a paragraph ? " Much like the number of sentences in a paragraph , there 's no single answer to this question . A rule of thumb answer is , " There are usually 100 to 200 words in a paragraph , " but a more accurate answer would be " It depends " which is n't particularly helpful . So let 's take a more in-depth look at word count , paragraphs and how it all works . <h> What does a paragraph usually consist of ? <p> A paragraph usually deals with a single idea . In general , you 'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea , and several supporting sentences to round it off . Paragraphs are usually about 100 200 words long , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Commercial Writing <p> Commercial writing breaks all the rules . Whether or not you find it irritating , your task is to hold your readers attention and get them to read what you 've written . The average person does n't  like to see solid blocks of text . It looks like its going to be difficult to get through , and nobody likes to work harder than they have to . <p> " White Space " is a great way to make your information look easier to master , and one of the best ways to create " white space " is through using paragraphs . For commercial writing , its best to keep sentences short and punchy , and the same goes for paragraphs . <p> People do n't  usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long . How many words is that ? Again , although its not helpful , the answer is " It depends " Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length at least from a psychological perspective . <p> For example , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged . The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long . This is the shortest one so far , and it only uses 37 words . <p> I want to get your attention ! <p> The above paragraph is only six words long , and you can count the words in this one if you like . <h> Dialogues <p> To make things easy for your reader , you 'll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers , for example : <p> " I do n't  know how long a paragraph should be , " said Mary , " but I hope to find out by reading this article . " <p> " That sounds like a good idea , " John replied , " but do n't  let that limit your creativity ! " <p> " Really ? Can I bend the rules ? " <p> " The rules are really more like guidelines . " <p> " Cool ! " <p> As you can see , I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that was even close to 100 words , but its still easy to see who said what . Marys final paragraph was one word long . <h> Academic Writing <p> In academic writing , paragraphs will usually consist of the " standard " 100 200 words ( Burns , 2002 ) . You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge ( Phillips , 2014 ) with references . Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought , but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading ( Williams et al , 1994 ) . Smith ( 2004 ) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling . 200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words , you 'll soon see why this should be the case ( Me , 2015 ) . <p> Whew ! That was a marathon to read , was n't it ? <h> How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a takeaway , I 'd like to suggest that there are absolutely no hard-and-fast rules as to how many words a paragraph should be . <p> Making them too short , can look a little odd . <p> This is an excellent example . <p> But it can work in some cases . <p> On the other hand , having really long paragraphs might work for you , but not for your reader . A lot of text without " white space " is hard on the eyes , and the brain . I 've seen blog posts and web pages with absolutely no paragraphs to speak of . Did I want to read them ? Not really . It was too difficult to separate the ideas from one another and there just did n't  seem to be a good enough reason to read them if I could find the same information split up into bite-sized chunks that were easier to digest . So , whatever you do , do n't  forget the importance of paragraphs and keep them a bit shorter than this one , unless you 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above paragraph is " only " 122 words ( 656 characters ) long . Do you see what I mean when I say that longer is n't always better ? I 'm ready to bet that you do .

Yes , its time for the dreaded New Years resolution . This year , in addition to trying to lose weight , quit smoking , save money , or give up some other addiction , why not resolve to improve a part ( or parts ) of your writing life ? You might find that fixing up your writing life leads to improvement in other areas as you gain confidence and success in your work . And even if it does n't  , youve still accomplished something significant . Here are some ideas to get you started . <h> Finish the Project <p> Whether you 're working on a book , short story , article , or poetry , finish whatever it is you 're working on . Its easy to get sidetracked or frustrated and jump from project to project , never finishing anything . But a finished work ( and by finished , I mean revised , edited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing you should be submitting for publication , which is resolution #2 . <h> Submit the Project <p> Just do n't  submit it until its finished . In the rush to feel like you 're making progress its tempting to send things out too soon . Resist this urge and wait until its as great as you can make it . You might get rejected , but you might also get accepted . Submitting the work is the only way to know for sure . <h> Try Something New <p> If you normally write novels , try a memoir . If you normally write short articles , try a novel or short story . Trying new forms of writing keeps the creative juices flowing and may introduce you to something you really enjoy . <h> Call Yourself a Writer <p> Do you write ? Then you 're a writer and you shouldnt be afraid to label yourself as such . Too many of us hem and haw when asked , " What do you do ? " Just own it . " I 'm a writer . " <h> Exercise <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its especially important for writers . We tend to spend too much time sitting on our butts . ( Whether were working or mindlessly surfing the Internet and calling it " work , " the result is the same . Too much butt-sitting . ) In addition to just being good for you , exercise boosts creativity and gives your mind a chance to roam free for a while . Bonus points if you can go outside and get some fresh air and new scenery . <h> Make Writing a Priority <p> Find them time in your day to write . This may mean skipping other fun activities , or letting some chores or errands pile up for another day . Do whatever you have to do to make writing a priority in your life instead of something that you do in your spare time . <h> Read More <p> Good writers read a lot . Read fiction , non-fiction , poetry , memoir , or the back of cereal boxes . You 'll get ideas and improve your craft by studying those who do it better ( and worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already keep a journal , resolve to be more consistent about writing in it . Or , start a different kind of journal . Maybe you 're keeping one that tracks your daily activities , but can you also add one dedicated to your creativity or travel ? Writing about something new can open you up to new ideas . If you do n't  keep a journal , start one . It gives you some writing practice and may let you see ideas and problems in ways you have n't before . <h> Learn at Least One New Thing <p> Take a class in something or make an effort to study on your own . It does n't  have to be writing related . The more things you know , the deeper your well of experience that you can draw upon when writing .

You do n't  have to be super positive all the time , but do n't  flog yourself to death . If you get rejected , try to say , " That one did n't  work out . Ill try again . " This is supposed to be fun and if all you 're doing is beating up on yourself , that 's not fun or healthy . <h> Back-Up Your Data <p> We all know we should do this , but a surprising number of people do not . Do you really want to try to rewrite your novel from scratch , or pay someone several hundred dollars to try and recover your data in the event of computer failure ? And remember : If you lose your laptop , recovery is n't an option . A backup drive or cloud service can be had for $100 or less and is well worth it for the peace of mind . <h> Get Organized <p> This is another one that many people attempt every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing just your writing life . ( Many people give up on this one because organizing the whole house seems impossible , but since you 're only going to organize your writing space , you 're already ahead of the crowd .

It does n't  have to be pretty or trendy , just functional . <h> Set a Realistic Overall Goal for the Year <p> Maybe your goal is to query twenty agents or get six new clients . Maybe you want to complete a novel and a short story , or to earn 5% more than you did last year . Pick one goal for the year and then spend the year tracking your progress . Just be realistic . You probably wont finish thirty novels this year , nor will you make 50% more than you did last year . Being realistic leads to success . Overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consistently <p> One of the challenges of writing is showing up for work every day . There 's always so much else you could ( maybe should ) be doing . Train yourself to show up every day . Marking a calendar with an " X " or a sticker every day that you write is a good idea . After a few days of consistently showing up , you 'll have a nice string of marks that you wo n't want to break . When tempted to skip out on a day , the thought of breaking that string will get you in the chair . <h> Volunteer <p> While not directly related to writing , volunteering gets you out of the house , off your butt , and exposes you to people and events that might provide fodder for your work . And it does something good for others , which is good for your soul . You can also volunteer for causes that are writing-related .

Your website does n't  have to be huge or technologically advanced , but it should be professional and informative . <h> Talk Less , Write More <p> Do you find yourself talking about your work more than actually doing it ? If you spend more time talking about how youd like to write , your dreams , and your works in progress , shut up and write . Talking wont get the work done and published . Writing will . <h> Enter a Contest <p> You might not win , but simply entering forces you to produce a work and submit it , helping you to get past the whole , " I 'm afraid of finishing anything and getting rejected " hurdles . And if you do win , fame and fortune might be yours . Or you might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning is winning . <h> Figure out What 's Broken <p> If you 're having trouble even getting to the chair and producing anything , somethings broken . Maybe its your routine . You might be better of writing in the morning rather than in the afternoon or vice versa . Maybe your writers group is n't fun anymore and they 're dragging you down . Maybe you 're feeling negative vibes from your significant other that he or she does n't  like the time you spend writing . Maybe you do n't  like the type of writing you 're doing anymore .

I 'm so happy for you . " Success for one person does n't  mean there will be none for you . Its not like grabbing the last TV at the Black Friday blowout sale . Be kind and encouraging to others .

No , its never going to be a laugh-a-minute job , but it should n't be something you hate , either . Maybe you need to try a new form or genre , or just stop taking everything so seriously . <h> Stop Procrastinating <p> There are lots of ways to conquer writers procrastination . Before you let it eat away your productivity , figure out why you do it and then get over it . Every day that you do n't  write is another missed opportunity . This is the easiest way to find more time to write . <h> Conquer Your Fear of Revision <p> Too many writers have bunches of first drafts littering their hard drives , yet they never send them out because revision leaves them cold . The first draft was fun . Revision feels like drudgery . Get over it . Read books or take a class in editing and revision .

Seek out balanced coverage and form your own opinions . <h> Share <p> Its easy to cocoon yourself in your house with your manuscripts , but you need the input of other people to make your work better . Sure , you think you 're a genius , but what do other people think ? Sharing is scary , though , because it feels risky . " What if they hate it ? Ill have wasted all this time . " Get past the fear . Find people you trust to give you good ( not necessarily positive ) feedback and share your work with them . You 'll get a more realistic picture of how you 're doing . <h> Stop Comparing Yourself to Others <p> Some people make a boatload of money . Others make a more modest amount . Some writers are on TV all the time while others are virtual recluses . No one way is right for everyone , so stop wasting time comparing your career with everyone elses . Every career moves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors and influences . Figure out what you want and then go for that , not what you think everyone else is doing . <h> Improve Your Vocabulary <p> You do n't  have to tackle everything on this list . That would ensure failure before you even get the holiday decorations packed away . Just pick one or two that motivate you and then pace yourself so that you spread the effort out over the year .

Its helped me a lot to put together a better list of writing goals for 2016 than I was coming up with by myself . I hope all the writers out there have a greatly productive year of writing ! <p> I 've already failed at all my wring resolutions , so m trying to make more realistic ones . I hate failing to do the writing I want to do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more realistic . here 's hoping this time around is better than hen I began in January . 
@@12747291 @1347291/ <h> Month : November 2015 <p> There 's often a lot of confusion , but if you 're looking for a general answer to the question , " How many sentences in a paragraph ? " the answer is there are 3 to 8 sentences in a paragraph . The important key to take away from this answer is that its a rule-of-thumb . If you 're looking for a hard and fast rule , you 're out of luck . A paragraph can consist of a single sentence , and since a single word can be a sentence , you can literally have a paragraph that consists of a single word . Of course , if someone asks you to write a paragraph , they wont be altogether happy with that , so how much should you write ? <h> What do teachers want to see in a paragraph ? <p> If you 're a student , your teacher or tutor may ask you to write a paragraph without telling you just how long he or she expects it to be . In general , educators like to see a paragraph consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses an idea . Use the next 3 sentences for providing information that supports that idea , and use the final sentence to draw a conclusion . <p> Why do teachers expect longer paragraphs ? Obviously , they want to see that you have acquired knowledge and can think critically . That 's quite difficult- to demonstrate with a single sentence ! Teachers will sometimes set a rule that all paragraphs should be a certain length , but its important to remember that specific paragraph lengths are n't  a prerequisite for acceptable writing . <h> When do you use shorter paragraphs ? <p> Open just about any book , and you 'll find plenty of short paragraphs . If direct speech is used , therell be a new paragraph every time a new speaker starts to talk . News writers also like using short paragraphs . They have to present information in a succinct way and hold the readers attention . <p> Commercial writers know that most people do n't  want to read 1,000 words of closely-spaced text in order to see what they are writing about , so they also like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of sub-headers so you can see what each paragraph is about before you read it . <h> How do I know when to start a new paragraph ? <p> Every time you begin- to discuss a new thought that contributes to the overarching theme of your work , you can start- a new paragraph . A paragraph will usually consist of a collection of sentences that , when considered as a group , have something in common . As soon as you move on to the next idea , you can begin a new paragraph . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to agonise about it too much , because as I 've pointed out , there are no specific rules . <h> Tips for writing strong paragraphs <p> Its best to begin a paragraph with a sentence that defines the topic that will be discussed . Try to keep it fairly simple . If you include too many ideas in your opening sentence , you run the risk of getting tangled in an overly complex and incoherent paragraph . Every sentence in a paragraph should support the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new or related topic , start a new paragraph . <p> The University of North Carolina helps students with paragraph construction by providing them with a 5-step process : <p> Express the idea that the paragraph will cover in a topic sentence . <p> Explain the idea . <p> Use an example . <p> Explain why the example relates to the idea . <p> Draw a conclusion . <p> Obviously , the recipe has been designed for those who want to write an informative and convincing work . And because these rules are n't  really cast in stone , you 'll find that different institutions give different recommendations . <h> The debate continues <p> If we look around , well find that the idea of paragraphs with a minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common . But there are some who say that two to three paragraphs per page are best and others who say that 5 to 7 lines will do the job . Meanwhile , journalism students are taught to keep sentences as short as possible , and one sentence paragraphs are considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using more than one paragraph to discuss an idea is perfectly alright , and since there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs , I cant really contradict them . I even found one recommendation that suggested a minimum of 7-10 sentences per paragraph and a maximum of a full page ! <h> How long should your paragraphs be ? <p> Unless you 're busy with academic writing , the length of your paragraphs is up to you . I like shorter paragraphs for informal writing such as this blog post . I like the idea of sticking to one idea per paragraph , and I think that paragraphs make reading and understanding a text a whole lot simpler . Single-sentence paragraphs are great for emphasis . <p> If you are writing to pass a school , college or university course , I recommend you ask your teacher or professor what 's expected of you . Its always better to ask in these situations than to try to guess . This is by far the best way to make sure you tailor your writing to what your teacher expects rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basketball fan but are n't  too familiar with the Golden State Warriors , you may be a bit confused by their nickname . If you look in the stands at the signs the fans display at Golden State Warrior games or listen to commentators talking about the team , you will soon realize that the team is known as " the Dubs " and the fans as " DubNation . " <h> Why are the Golden State Warriors called the Dubs ? <p> The Warriors are called " the Dubs " in a truncated pronunciation of the " W " of Warriors <p> The Dubs is one of those nicknames or terms that does n't  seem to make much sense when you first hear or see it . In fact , one of the reasons you 're likely reading this article is because you could n't figure out why the Warriors are called that on your own . While it may at first appear strange , once you realize where it comes from , it makes a lot more sense . <p> The nickname began in the 1990s when younger fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the team . Instead of pronouncing the teams full name , some fans began to refer to the team as the " Ws " . " W " soon was changed from its proper pronunciation to " dub-a-u , " which then was further shortened to just " dub . " As the team became more popular with the younger generation using this slang to describe the team , the term caught on with the general public , and the team began to refer to themselves in this manner as well . So while The Dubs may seem a little strange at first , its simply a shortening of the team name " Warriors " over time . <h> Why are the Warriors fans called Dub Nation ? <p> Dub Nation is how fans refer to themselves as a collective whole . If you 're a Golden State Warriors fan , then you are part of the Dub Nation . Since it was the fans who originally came up with the nickname of the Dubs for the Warriors , they also began to call themselves by the same term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans use the same abbreviation for " Warriors " and began to call themselves the " Dub Nation . " <h> Why are the Warriors called the doves ? <p> The Warriors and their fans do n't  refer to themselves as the doves , although people thinking they call themselves " the doves " is a common misconception . The reason this happens is n't too difficult to surmise . Since there is a similar pronunciation between the words " Dub " and " Dove , " it makes sense that the two words could get mixed up . This is especially true sine " Dub " is n't a normal word in the English language , so many people likely mishear it as the closest real word they know , which happens to be " dove . " <h> Why are the Warriors called The City ? <p> When the Warriors first moved to the west coast in 1962 , the were located in San Francisco and were called the San Francisco Warriors . " The City " logo was created in the years before they moved across the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The City " refers to San Francisco even though the Warriors currently are located in Oakland ( but will be moving to a new stadium there soon ) . <p> " The City " logo uniforms were brought back in the mid-2000s as a throwback uniform . Theyre iconic for the area , look good , and most importantly , sell well as merchandise . Since they are one of the most popular logos for fans , the Warriors use this throwback uniform on a regular basis these days . <h> Why do the Warriors rub their arms ? <p> The Golden State Warriors have a unique 3-point celebration . If you watch the Warriors bench ( and now many of the fans in the crowd as well ) you will often see them make a 3-point gesture that might not make sense at first sight . The bench ( and crowd ) will stand up and point their arm toward the sky making an " okay " sign ( thumb and pointer finger in a circle with the other three fingers sticking out ) , then take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the outstretched arm . <p> The gesture is supposed to represent a shotgun being fired and then reloaded . Its the teams way of showing approval toward the 3-point shooting ability of their teammates , and acknowledging that the players are " locked and loaded " and ready to score . The gesture originated on the warriors bench from Shaun Livingston , who brought it with him when he joined the Warriors . It stuck , and it now can be seen many times throughout most Warriors games . <p> Whether you want to do a word count or a character count , it helps to know the number of letters in the alphabet . Knowing the correct number of letters in the alphabet depends greatly on which languages alphabet you are referring to . While many may assume you 're talking about English , that might not always be the best assumption since there are so many different languages around the world . Below are the answers to this question for some of the more popular world languages . <h> How many letters are there in the English alphabet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which range from a to z ( with b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t , u , v , w , x , and y in between ) . What many people do n't  know is as recently as 200 years ago , there used to be 27 letters in the English alphabet . While many probably are familiar with the number of letters in English ( if they are native English speakers ) , they may not be quite as familiar with the numbers in other languages . <h> How many letters are there in the Arabic alphabet ? <p> Those curly letters do look pretty , and there are 28 letters in Arabic just two more than the English alphabet . Sounds simple ? Perhaps not as simple as it looks ! All 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet are consonants . <p> That 's not to say that Arabic does n't  have vowels . It does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a " diacritical mark " a glyph that 's added to a consonant . Just to make things more confusing , you wo n't always bother with vowels . Theyre essential if you 're quoting the Quran or if you 're writing a book for children , but most of the time , you just leave them out . <h> How many letters are there in the Chinese alphabet ? <p> Now things get really complicated ! If you want to have functional literacy in Chinese , you " only " need to know three or four thousand characters . And I say " only " because there are literally tens of thousands of Chinese characters . <p> That 's because Chinese does n't  actually have an alphabet at all . Instead of the marks you make representing sounds , they represent ideas ( ideograms ) or pictures ( pictograms ) . And of course , you can combine ideas and get compound pictograms . So the word " good " is represented by the ideogram for " woman " and the ideogram for " child " superimposed on one another . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To read Japanese , you 'll need to know about 2,000 symbols from three " alphabets . " The first of these is known as " kanji , " and it consists of pictograms that originated in China . Then there are two phonetic alphabets , " hiragana " and " katakana . " At least these two alphabets actually represent sounds , so they are easier for a foreigner to learn and understand . Both hiragana and katakana have 46 letters . <h> How many letters are there in the Korean alphabet ? <p> Westerners may heave a sigh of relief when they hear that the Korean alphabet , known as the Hangul in the South and the Chosangul in the North , consists of 24 characters and there are vowels too . However , we may have some difficulty piecing together some Korean writing , because Korean characters are arranged in blocks that become syllables . So what looks like a single character to us , may be a combination of characters representing a sound . <h> How many letters are there in the Russian alphabet ? <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabet consisting of 33 letters . 10 of these are vowels , 21 are consonants and there are two additional " signs " to learn . Luckily , Russian is a phonetic language , so you can learn what sounds each letter represents and take it from there . <h> How many letters are there in the Spanish alphabet ? <p> English speakers will feel as if they 're on some familiar ground with the Spanish alphabet but be warned there are actually 29 letters in the Spanish alphabet . The extra four are ch , ll , + and rr , each of which represents a different sound . And while were talking about sounds , " h " may be vital to spelling , but its a silent letter . <h> How many letters are there in the Italian alphabet ? <p> Although Italian may not be the easiest language in the world if you take grammar into account , the alphabet is a breeze . It only has 21 letters . " Foreign " letters : j , k , w , x and y are borrowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to learn a few spelling rules before you can join a spelling bee . <h> How many letters are there in the Greek alphabet ? <p> From Alpha to Omega , were looking at 24 letters in the Greek alphabet . Greek is one of the oldest scripts still in use , and its one of the roots of Latin script that determines how we write today . Once one gets used to the different-looking letters and how they should sound , there should be few problems reading Greek even without understanding it . Its a phonetic language with few tricky vices to throw you off . <h> How many letters are there in the German alphabet ? <p> Despite some formatting differences and the presence of the umlaut , which has different effects on pronunciation depending on where you put it , the German alphabet has the 26 letters that English speakers are used to . Of course , learning an alphabet and learning a language are two different things . Reading German is n't all that difficult once you have some vocabulary , but becoming fluent with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that everyone understands <p> Its important to remember that alphabets are n't  everything when it comes to communication . You do n't  have to be a linguist to smile , something everyone understands . The game of charades , which is often the foreigners last resort when verbal communication fails , can also get you through some tight spots . It may not always be effective , but even when it is n't , it usually provokes hilarity at the very least . <p> The Harry Potter books are popular , and once someone reads the first book in the series , they often end up reading the entire series .

Now you know you can congratulate anyone who has read all the Harry Potter books of reading more than a million words . <h> 10 Surprising Facts About Harry Potter <p> For anyone who has taken the time to manually count the number of words on a page of paper , you know its both time consuming and frustrating . There has to be a better way . Fortunately , word counters can easily give you the information for your own writing , but what if you need to know the exact number of words for a particular page ? Getting this information is a bit more difficult . <p> There could be a number of reasons you want to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you have an assignment which requires you to write a certain number of pages , so youd like to know how many words are needed to fill a page . The problem is there 's not a definitive answer to this questions because there are so many factors that go into calculating the number of words on a page . <p> For those looking for a general rule of thumb , you can estimate that there are about 250 words on a page double spaced , or 500 words on a page single spaced . This is a rough estimate and the true number of words on the page is likely to be more or less . This may not be a big factor for the single page , but if you are estimating for a lot of pages , the actual number can be significantly different than the estimated number . <p> If you know some basics about the writing and the page , you can get a much more accurate estimate by using a Words per Page calculator . This will allow you to input the font type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Times New Roman or Verdana ) , the font size , and whether the page is single or doubled spaced . Using this information and the number of words , the calculator can give a more accurate estimate than using the rule-of-thumb estimate . You also have the option of using the " type your own Words " function to get the estimated number of pages for your writing . <p> Another reason you may be searching for how many words there are on a page is you may want to know the number of words for a particular page on the Internet . Since web pages are n't  limited to the size of a standard sheet of paper , the actual number of words on the page can vary wildly , and are often much larger than a typical paper page . In cases like this , you can use a Website Page Word Count calculator . <p> To find out this word count information , you simply input the URL of the websites page for which you need to know the number of words and the calculator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . Even better , it will also give you a list of the words used on the page including how many times each word is used . <p> One of the many Word Counter features writers often find useful is " Keyword Density . " This feature can be found below the " Details " feature in the right sidebar of the website . Keyword Density gives writers an understanding of the words they are using most frequently which allows them to make any necessary adjustments to their word use frequency . <p> Keyword Density has a default setting for all those who come to the site for the first time .

Of all the metrics the tool keeps track of , this is probably the one we receive the most questions about . With that in mind , we felt it would be beneficial to try to- explain in a little bit more detail how this metric works and what exactly it means . <p> First and foremost , Reading Level is n't a reflection of your writing skill in any way . You may have excellent writing which ranks at a fourth-grade reading level , while you may have substandard writing which ranks at the college reading level . There seems to be an assumption by many that a higher Reading Level rank means the writing is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better writing than a Reading Level at a tenth-grade level . This is not what this metric is measuring . <p> The only thing the Reading Level tries to do is give an indicator of the education level a person would need to have- in order to understand the words you 're using in your writing . Its not meant to be a ranking of your writing ability in any way . Its simply a general guideline so you can anticipate what education level a person would need to have- to understand what you have written . <p> WordCounter assesses Reading Level by using the Dale " Chall readability formula . This formula uses 3,000 common words a fourth grader should understand as its foundation . Basically , if you use only the words found in the list of 3,000 words when you write , your Reading Level rank will be at a fourth-grade level . As you use more words which are not on the list of 3,000 words , the Reading Level will increase . The more words you use that fall outside the core 3,000-word list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign to your writing . <p> When you first begin to type in the text area , Reading Level will display as N/A . In order for a Reading Level to appear , you will need to write a minimum of two sentences . The number of sentences is part of the formula used , and the more sentences in the writing , the more accurate the Readability Level will be . There 's a need for a two-sentence minimum to begin to make an accurate Reading Level determination . <p> With this in mind , when the metric shows your writing at " college level , " what its saying is that you 're using a significant number of words in your writing which a fourth grader wont be familiar with . If the Reading Level says fourth-grade level , then a fourth-grader would understand the vast majority of the words you used in your writing . If the metric says a seventh-grade level , you 're using some words that a typical fourth-grader would n't understand , but not as many as would be in the writing to rank the Reading Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for a number of reasons . If you are attempting to target your article , story or other writing to a specific audience who may be at a certain reading grade level , this metric can help make sure you 're not writing over their heads . At the same time , you may not want your writing to come across as too simplistic by using only common words elementary students would understand , and want to raise the number and variety of vocabulary in your writing to appeal to a higher educated reader . 
@@12747292 @1347292/ <h> Dealing With Negative Criticism of Your Writing <p> Its a fact of writing life : Sooner or later , someone is going to say something unkind or downright cruel about your work . Its going to be in a review on Amazon or ( heaven forbid ) a review in a major publication . Someone in your writers group is going to drop the pretense of being constructive and is going to point out all the flaws in your work . The comment trail on your blog is going to be populated by nasty trolls . Or , your loudmouth brother is going to make fun of your book at the family Christmas dinner . Brace yourself because it happens to all of us . <p> The first impulse is to get angry and to defend your work . Check yourself before you blow up , though . Responding to negativity with negativity just creates more problems . If you shoot your mouth off to the Publishers Weekly reviewer , do n't  expect them to ever review you again . If you engage in a battle on Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a diva who ca n't handle criticism . And getting into a battle with a comment trail troll is the biggest waste of time because they will hate you no matter what you do , simply because they want to hate something . You 'll never win any of these battles . You can defend your work all you want , but if they did n't  like it ( or you ) , nothing you can say will change their mind and youll only look like an argumentative jackass . <p> So how can you deal with criticism ? Here are some ideas . <h> Vent in private <p> If you have to go off on someone , do it in private . Vent to your partner , the dog , or the bare walls . Tell them all the nasty things you cant say to the person who 's criticizing you . Get it off your chest and then let it go . <h> Look for the kernel of truth <p> Sometimes there is some truth in criticism , no matter how unkindly worded it may be . Try to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your characters weak ? Your plot derivative ? Your article short on facts ? If there 's something useful in there , think about it and see if its something you can use going forward . <h> Try gratitude <p> It may seem silly to actually thank someone who is criticizing you , but not all criticism comes from meanness . Some of it comes from people who genuinely desire to help you produce better work . Try thanking them for taking the time to read your work and offer advice . You might even want to ask for more . <h> Remind yourself that you 're dealing with individual taste <p> This is perhaps the most important lesson to learn . Taste is subjective and not everyone will like everything . If someone says they hate your book , it may simply be that they did n't  care for the genre , point of view , subject matter or any of a hundred other reasons that are taste based . You do n't  like everything you read , so why should you expect all of your readers to love your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticism stems from something like a typo or a misreported fact and your piece is online , fix it . If your work is in print you 'll have to wait for another printing to address any errors , but notify the publishers so that things can be corrected . In the meantime , you can post corrections on your website . Thank the person for pointing out your mistakes . <h> If its too late to fix it , let it go <p> If you cant do anything about it right now , let it go . You can ask that mistakes be corrected in a reprint or post corrections on your site , but beyond that you have to let it go . Just try to do better the next time . <h> Realize that some people are just mean <p> Some people get their jollies from making others feel bad . You probably learned this in elementary school and its still true today . Writers make easy targets for those who want to pick on someone . And the more successful you are , the bigger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother told you in elementary school . Ignore the bullies . Engaging them just gives them more power . <h> Ignore personal attacks <p> Simply choose to ignore personal attacks , attacks that make no sense , and attacks that have no relevance to your work . Its one thing to criticize your work , but comments like , " You must be fat and ugly , " " You 're a dumbass , " or , " You must sit around all day just thinking of ways to suck , " have nothing to do with the work . They are the product of someone who just wants to stir things up , or who has other issues . There 's nothing constructive or productive you can take from them so let them go . <h> Do n't  let it stop you <p> If every writer who received negative feedback quit writing , we 'd have no books . If you see a continuous pattern of people who do n't  like your work and who are saying the same things it may be time to rethink your style , genre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve . You do n't  quit just because of criticism . You get better . <h> Do n't  take it personally <p> If someone is legitimately criticizing your work , do n't  turn it into a personal attack . Your writing is not you . If someone says your sentence structure is weak , that does n't  mean that you are weak . If someone says your character acted like an idiot , that does n't  mean you are an idiot . Work is work and you are you . Separate the two and respond accordingly . <h> Discuss it <p> Discussing it is not defending your work . It is not saying , " Hey , I made the choice to kill off the main character because it felt right and that was my choice to make , not yours . " Discussing criticism means asking for clarification or inviting the reviewer to expound on their critique , particularly in the case where the review or comment was brief . Then you can talk about ways to address those concerns . A true discussion can be good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they can learn how to make their critiques more useful . <h> Get support <p> While you can try to be big about taking criticism , sometimes you just need people to tell you you 're great and loved . Talk it over with your friends or partner . Have someone who likes your work reassure you . Reread some positive reviews/comments to reassure yourself that its not all bad . <h> Put it in perspective <p> If you have 600 positive reviews and thirty negatives , the negatives are only five percent of the total . No matter how angry or offensive they are , they are n't  the majority , or even close . Use numbers to give you some perspective . <p> Criticism happens to everyone . Look at the bright side if someone is criticizing you it means that you 've actually put your work out there and made people think about it . If you 've got a bunch of trolls and haters ragging on you , that may very well be a ( twisted ) sign of success . They do n't  usually bother haranguing unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever achieve . <h> 13 comments <p> I am quite sensitive and find it difficult when I get feedback like this . I am getting more used to it but it is still hard . For example I had an unsubscribe from my list recently and the feedback was " SCAM " now it was a free ebook asking for their credit card details . It was free and the idea worked for me so not sure why someone would say that . I am starting to realise that it does n't  matter what you do , if you are online there will be people who are rude and nasty . <p> hahaha if I got an email like this , I would assume it was a scam as well . Why would anyone give their credit card details to a complete stranger ? That 's not criticism of your writing skills , that 's just plain common sense <p> Great article Jennifer ! I also agree that having a open discussion about someones critique of ones work can be a very productive way to bridge the digital gap between the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect you much more for being open-minded enough to take what they had to say into consideration and ask more questions about what they did n't  like about your work and why . Cheers ! <p> That 's a great and very useful article ! These points can actually help me in more topics than just my writing , so I say thank you for that . I will keep these things in mind for when I get a critique on anything I might do that somebody finds the need to be negative about . <p> I 'm a critic , and I actually agree with you . When someone gets overly defensive and angry over my simply telling what I see , I tend to pass that person off as immature , I certainly never deal with them again . <p> Now when someone confronts me on it maturely , asks for advice or help , or even pulls out just the acceptance card ? That brings a smile to my face . I 'm more than willing to waste a few hours of my time helping them past that problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples as to how they can work on it . I 've even made quite a few friends that way . <p> Basically , you need to realize the difference between a troll , a critic , and an bully . A critic sees a problem and writes it down in detail . A troll makes a problem or senses an insecurity and focuses in on it with the intention of hurting you . A bully wants nothing more than to hurt you , most of the time because it makes them feel better . <p> I understand that professional writing is a lot different from fanfiction but the general idea is still there . Analyze the criticism , dig deep and see if you can get anything out of it . If you cant , maybe it is n't true . If you can , use it to your advantage . Feeling sorry for yourself or defensive creates stasis . Everyone has a contact who can give them advice , so if you 're confused bring it to them . Maybe they can help . <p> Oh and at least on fanfiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile when someones giving you crap for no reason . <p> This is so important . Criticism can be valid even if you do n't  like it . If you refuse to accept valid criticism , you are only hurting yourself and your writing will never get better . If you are n't  willing to listen to criticism at all , you shouldnt be a writer because no matter how good of a writer you are , you can always get better . <p> " Oh and at least on fanfiction , no one really trolls the little guy , so smile when someone 's giving you crap for no reason . " <p> This is what stood out when I read your reply . If people start critiquing your fanfiction , that means you 're doing something right . Youve reach the point where someones feels its relevant enough to comment on it which is a huge step above silence . <p> Great tips ! I think its important not to lose heart when you receive negative criticism . Everybody likes different things , and I 'm sure there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemingway or Steinbeck are that good of writers or care for their work . Good thing those guys did n't  give up ! <p> One more thing I would like to add about criticism of any kind : Whether you are dishing it out to your **39;1241;TOOLONG boyfriend , or writing a professional book review , do not criticize the PERSON . Criticize the ACTION or lack thereof I read a review on Amazon today that was all " The author is really stupid to " " The author must be a real b%*&amp; . . . " that 's not helping anyone , and the only person who looks like B%*&amp; is the person writing the review . <p> This is a wonderful blog post , as are all the posts I have come across on this blog please keep up the good work , Jennifer ! It was also great to see a critic get in on the discussion and I sincerely appreciate both his input and his willingness to help those willing to accept true , professional criticism ( which is by definition constructive ) as an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the exact opportunity we should actively be seeking out , and for which we should always be grateful . <p> Too many critics try to make the criticism personal and as soon as they do that , any criticism becomes moot no matter how relevant it may be . As you said , critic the work , not the person . Too many are n't  able to distinguish the difference . <p> I want to be a writer , but everyone always tells me that my writing is n't good enough . Its so discouraging . They say that I should try and get a job doing something that 's more stable . The thing is , I do n't  want to do something else . I want to be a writer . That 's my dream , but its so discouraging when everybody else tells you that you should do something other than your dream . How do I get rid of this negativity so that I can continue to pursue what I want to ? <p> Its time to get new friends . Truly , if your friends do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then are they really friends ? A great place to get support for your writing is to join a writers group in your area . It will help a lot and give a lot of positive reinforcement to your writing . 
@@12747293 @1347293/ <h> Getting the Most from a Writers Retreat <p> A writers retreat can be a rewarding experience . It gives you a chance to get away from your everyday distractions and really get some work done . It can also give you a chance to experience a new location and meet new people . ( Note the difference between a retreat and a conference : A conference will have lots of seminars , breakout sessions , critique groups , and meet and greets with publishing professionals . A retreat is pretty much you and your work , alone , for a period of time . There may be some scheduled activities , but far fewer than at a conference . ) There are plenty of commercially organized retreats , or you can create your own by picking a secluded location and heading off for a few days . <p> A retreat can be a great way to immerse yourself in your craft and it can even be a way to learn if writing is for you . ( I know one person who went on a retreat and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . It was worth it , I guess . At least he now knows what he does n't  want to do with his life . ) The chance to spend a week or weekend just writing is very appealing , but it can be pricey . You want to get the most bang for your buck . You do n't  want to waste your time or fail to gain any benefit from your retreat . Before you book your reservations , here are some things you can do to prepare so you get the most out of the retreat . <h> Be ( somewhat ) social <p> If there are publishing or writing professionals present at the retreat , take some time to meet with them . They can provide you insight into the positives of your work , or become helpful contacts when you 're ready to publish . Writing is the primary reason you 're here , but do n't  forget to take advantage of networking and feedback opportunities , if offered . <h> Bring what you need <p> You do n't  want to waste precious retreat time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trying to track down that article that you really need . Double check your packing and make sure you have everything you need to begin writing as soon as you 're settled in . Also make sure your laptop is in working order and that you have all accessories like chargers , portable printers , flash drives , etc . Bring plenty of notebooks , pens , pencils , highlighters , page flags , index cards , or any other supplies that you use in your writing . <h> Be open to the experience <p> Having uninterrupted time to write can be startling and even upsetting . Some people just do n't  know what to do with that kind of quiet time and they try to fill it with everything except writing . Resist the urge to check your Facebook page , answer email , or call your family to fill the void . Open your mind and embrace the experience . Get used to the solitude and make the most of it . <h> Respect the experience of others <p> Everyone is at the retreat to work . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , do n't  be the chatterbox who 's knocking on doors late at night looking for company or who 's coaxing your new friends out to visit the city when they 're trying to work . <h> Demand that others respect your experience <p> Be very clear in saying , " No , " if you 'd rather work than go out to dinner with others . Get good at telling people ( politely , if possible ) to buzz off while you 're working . Some people will try to bug you to death , but you 're at the retreat to work . Most will get the hint quickly , but there may be a few that wont get it until you 're downright rude . <h> Go alone <p> Many people are most productive when they go to a retreat alone , without anyone they know . They might make a couple of new friends while there , but they are n't  tempted by the easy distractions that an established friendship offers . <h> Or take a friend <p> On the other hand , some people are more comfortable having someone they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , make sure its a writer friend ( non-writers will be bored and may unintentionally cause problems for others ) and make sure its someone you feel comfortable saying , " Get lost , " to when you need to work . <h> Make a plan and a schedule <p> While there may be some scheduled activities , much of your time will be your own . It can help to have goals and schedules to give your days some form . Promise you 'll write 1,000 words before going to lunch , or divide your days into blocks of time for writing , eating , exercise , meditation , etc . Having some structure can help you overcome the problems that come with having too much freedom . You 'll also want to plan what you 're going to work on ahead of time . Do n't  waste time deciding whether to work on your novel or your non-fiction book . <h> Plan for food <p> Some retreats offer prepared meals while others give you accommodations with a small kitchen . If you 'll have to do your own cooking , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you need and not keep making trips to the market . Think of easy meals you can prepare quickly . <h> Take breaks <p> While you 're at the retreat to work , you do n't  want to fry your brain . You 're useless if you get too tired . Rest , recharge , and then go back to work . Use some free time to sleep , explore your destination , meditate , or exercise . <h> Choose the right retreat for you <p> Retreats vary in length and offerings . Some are in big cities and offer lots of things to do when you 're not working . Others are in almost monastic conditions and writing is the only thing to do . Some offer activities and feedback opportunities , others offer nothing . Try to gauge what sort of retreat will make you happy and productive and find one that matches your ideal .

One of these new features is the countdown goal counter . This feature allows writers to set a word ( character , sentence or paragraph ) count goal they need to reach or must stay under in their writing . <p> This feature is simple to use . Click on the " Goal " button directly above where you place text into Word Counter . Once done , a small " Set Goal " screen will appear which will say , " Enter the number of characters , words , sentences or paragraphs you want to set a goal . " In the first space , you place the goal number to write , then choose words , characters , sentences or paragraphs . You must also choose whether this amount is a minimum ( you want to write at least this many words ) or a maximum ( you do n't  want to write over this many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of information , press the " Set " button and you 'll be back to the main page , but just to the right of the Goal button will be a counter with the goal you just set .

Once your goal is reached when you set a minimum amount , the counter will turn green to let you know you 've succeeded . If you set a limit with a maximum amount , the counter will turn red to let you know if you exceed the number . <p> This feature can prove to be quite useful for a number of different writers .

Its also a great feature for those who are trying to write a certain number of words on a daily basis . Using the goal setter will allow the writer to know where she stands in relation to her daily goal . <p> For some writers , it can also be seen as an excellent motivational tool . Those who are aiming to write more can use the tool to set a specific goal , and then they can watch as they get closer and closer to their set goal . Watching this number decrease as they write can be encouraging , and help encourage writers meet a daily minimum word count . 
@@12747295 @1347295/ <h> Do n't  Lie About Your Writing <p> Its funny that a profession that often prides itself on telling the truth offers so many opportunities to lie . Journalists often claim to pursue the truth at all costs . Fiction writers spout off about finding " the truth " in their stories . Almost every kind of writer espouses some sort of devotion to the truth . Yet every year , more and more writers are caught lying . Whether its passing off someone elses work as your own ( plagiarism ) or faking reviews on Amazon , there 's a lot of lying going on . <p> It would seem like common sense that you should n't lie . Yet in the crowded , competitive , demanding world of writing , too many people take shortcuts in their efforts to get ahead of the pack . But lying in your writing can destroy a career , even if you do n't  rely on writing to make a living . When I was in graduate school , I knew someone who faked his entire dissertation . All of the interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data and people to support the " ground breaking " conclusion he was trying to draw so he made it all up . He got caught and tossed out of school . His future career in that field and all of the teaching and researching he hoped to do were gone because he lied . <p> Granted , that 's a pretty spectacular case of career suicide , but there are many others . Remember James Frey who made up a memoir and got taken down by Oprah ? Or Jonah Leher who faked quotes attributed to Bob Dylan ( among quite a few other infractions ) . Or Jayson Blair who fabricated almost every aspect of his stories for The New York Times ? While some of these notorious liars have gone on to resurrect their careers , do n't  think for one minute that it would be as easy for the average Joe to return to successful work after such a debacle . <p> So , since it does n't  seem to be obvious to some , what constitutes lying ? Take a look . ( And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to set yourself apart from the crowd . They 're lies , pure and simple . ) <h> Faking statistics and data <p> Its not okay to say that 30% of people agree with your position if there is no hard data to support that conclusion . You do n't  get to make things up based on " gut feelings " or because you really want to write a spectacular article . Neither do you get to interview four of your friends and when three of them agree with your premise , report that as a 75% majority . <h> Faking quotes <p> If someone did n't  say it , you do n't  get to put it in their mouth anyway . You also ca n't take quotes out of context . Just because your point is better made if you leave out the last half of the quote does n't  mean you get to use it that way . You have to report quotes accurately and keep them within the context in which they were uttered . <h> Calling fiction non-fiction <p> If you made it up , its fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a factual recounting of your life , its fiction and not a memoir . If you write about an event that never happened or things that were never said , its fiction . Never pass something you made up as something that really happened . <h> Passing off old work as new <p> Yes , reporters and magazine writers repurpose old work all the time . They take that parenting article about camping with the kids and re-slant it so that it works for an outdoors magazine . It means that you can reuse research and save some time when writing the article . As long the work and wording is new , this is okay . What is n't okay is repeating the earlier work word for word . Editors pay for new content . Finding out that the piece they just published has already appeared in another publication , verbatim , is n't going to make them happy . Especially if you sold it as original work . <h> Plagiarism <p> This is stealing other peoples work and passing it off as your own . This is never okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school . If you use someone elses work , you have to give proper credit to the original author . <h> Writing fake reviews of your work <p> This has become a rampant problem on sites like Amazon . Authors create fake accounts to give glowing accounts of their own work . Its an effort to push their book to the top , to make it stand out amidst all the other books . Its harder than you think , though , to craft believable " voices " for your reviews . They will all end up sounding the same . Worse , if your book is receiving scads of terrible reviews and then you 've got these fifty five star reviews , someones going to figure out that you 're shilling your own work . Also , do n't  pay for positive reviews . Its fine to request reviews , but no ethical reviewer will take money in exchange for their opinion . <h> Altering reality <p> We often wish that things had happened more dramatically than they did . Sometimes writers " embellish " a story to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're just stretching the facts and that 's not okay . If it was boring when it happened , then you either need to report it that way or find something more exciting to cover . You 're writing a non-fiction piece , not a screenplay . Adding in explosions , deaths and drama is lying . <h> Pretending to be somewhere you are n't  <p> You can not pretend to be filing stories from Iraq if you 're in Cleveland . If you want to report " from " a region , youd better be there . <h> Doctoring photographs <p> Okay , a little Photoshopping is n't a bad thing . Touching up colors , etc. is acceptable . What 's not acceptable is putting people into photos who werent there , or capturing " action " that never happened so you can report on some unbelievable event . <p> Its not worth the risk to lie . In this day and age its incredibly easy to get caught . Everything can be cross-checked on the Internet or with a quick phone call or Twitter post . No matter what you think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're pulling one over on people , sooner or later it will come to an end and you will end up with no credibility and no career .

Below you 'll find three different simple present exercises to try so you can determine your understanding of this tense . The quizzes are easy to do . Simply fill in the blank spot with what you believe to be the correct simple present tense for each sentence ( the verb to be used is in parentheses ) . When you 're finished , you 'll automatically be given your score , as well as shown which , if any , exercise questions you missed . Good luck with the exercises ! <h> Exercise 1 <h> Exercise 2 <h> Exercise 3 <h> The Simple Present Tense <p> While the " simple present tense " may sound intimidating , this really is n't the case . You use this tense naturally all the time . The rules and applications are as simple as the name is not . So take three deep breaths and read on It all comes down to the verb or " doing word " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use it in the present tense , even though the thing it describes may not be happening at this particular moment . Let 's look at some examples : <h> You do something often or repeatedly <p> That 's one of the times you use this tense . For example , you might say : " I write at my desk " or " He writes at his desk . " It may also be something that you or someone else repeatedly does n't  do : " I do n't  write at my desk , " or : " He does n't  write at his desk . " <p> You may not be writing at your desk right at the moment , but its something you do , so you use the present tense to describe an existing habit or a habit you currently do n't  have , as we saw in the example . <p> Of course , that could be a question too : " Do you write at your desk ? " or " Does he write at his desk ? " The verb is present tense : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's look at things that habitually happen ( or do n't  happen ) .

" <p> In every case , you see the verb , in these examples , " write " or " leave " happening in the present tense . You would n't say " Does the bus left at 8:00AM ? " would you ? And if you were to say " I wrote at my desk , " thered be no indication of it being something you still do on a regular basis . In fact , it would look like something you do n't  do anymore , or do n't  plan to do again until further notice . <h> Make a generalization or tell it like it is <p> You 're not telling it like it was so obviously , the present tense in its simple form will fit the bill .

Your use of the simple present tense tells your listener that you 're talking about an existing situation that you expect wo n't change overnight . To stretch our example a little further , you could be denying or asking about a fact or a generalization . " Paris is not the capital of Spain , " or " Is Paris the capital of France ? " You can even use this tense to tell lies : " Paris is the capital of Spain . " Yes , its silly , but its still grammatically correct . <h> Things that you expect to happen <p> If you 're expecting something to happen pretty soon , you can use either the future tense or the simple present tense . Thus , it would be correct to say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just as easily say : " The flight boards at 6:00 AM , " and it would be as correct as our future tense example . As before , you can turn it into a question : " Does the flight board at 6:00AM ? " which is just as correct as its future tense relative " Will the flight board at 6:00AM ? " Yes ! Its happening now or maybe it is n't <p> This is the simplest use of the simple present tense . Its happening , or its supposed to be , but is n't , or you want to know if it is happening . " I am available now . " " I am not available now . " " Are you available now ? " Easy peasy , right ? <h> Look for the adverb ! <p> Habits will often be expressed with an adverb such as " sometimes " , " often " , " always " or " never " . You may not use the adverb , but it could be placed if you desired . For example , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always " or " never " into the example , and it would be correct ( I always write at my desk " or " I never write at my desk " . The same goes for " only " , " ever " , " still " " often " and " just " . <p> If your spouse were to ask : " Do you often stop at the pub on the way back from the gym ? " that 's also simple present tense . You might reply " No , I only go to the gym , " or " No , I never stop at the pub . " Of course , the truthful response may be " Yes , I often stop at the pub , " but whatever the reply , you 're using the simple present tense as did your spouse . <p> But if you say " The ball is caught by the dog , " magic happens . Because the first noun ( ball ) is acted upon by an external agency ( the dog ) , who performs the verb ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works with any passive voice simple present tense sentence : " The moon is illuminated by the sun , " or " The barking is done by the dog " or " The stock exchange is affected by the value of the dollar . " <p> Those are the basic rules when it comes to the simple present tense in English . If you werent able to get 100% on the exercises above , you can now try again with your new knowledge of how this tense works ! <p> Your resume is a make-or-break document . When you 're hunting for your dream job , your resume determines whether you 'll be shortlisted as a possible candidate or ignored before you even get a chance to make an impression in an interview . <p> I used to be an HR manager , and you 'll be relieved to know that an extremely complicated resume is n't going to get you anywhere no matter what any website marketing resume writing services may say . At the same time , you need to show that you 've made an effort . So what are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when creating your resume ? <h> Do n't  ! <p> Get someone else to write your resume . By all means get someone to check it for errors and proofread , but keep it your own work . Why ? Your resume should reflect your personality and writing skills . Recruiters will be quick to pick up any insincerity and discrepancies . <p> Turn it into a Magnum Opus . Recruiters get hundreds of resumes for every job advertised . They need to get a handle on who you are and what you can do at a glance . <p> Fret too much about formatting . Yes , your resume should look neat and well-ordered , but gorgeous formatting does n't  mean you 're going to get the job unless you happen to be applying for a job in which this ability would be important . <p> Say anything negative at any point . The same goes for your job interview . If you had a personality clash with your last employers or took them to the labor court , your resume is not the place to mention it , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Revise your resume based on the post for which you 're applying . Your prospective employer wants to know you 're interested in the specific post you 're applying for . Highlight the skills that would be the most useful in that position . <p> Keep it short , sweet and simple . Look at it this way . Some pressured HR employee has a stack of resumes on their desk and shes going to try and get the gist of yours as fast as possible . Make it easy for them . <p> Ensure its error-free . Mistakes make you look as if you werent willing to spend the time on the document at best . I 've personally trashed resumes because of obvious spelling errors . Why ? If the person ca n't put their best foot forward now , why should I expect them to do so later ? <p> Be sincere and factual . Do n't  play fast and loose with the truth and do n't  pretend to be someone you are n't  . Your sins will eventually catch up to you . <p> Put it through a word counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seeing how many times you use words within the resume can help make sure you are n't  overusing certain descriptors that might turn off a recruiter <h> Resume content <p> Now that we 've set some basic ground rules , its time to get down to the nitty-gritty . How should you order the content of your resume ? <h> Header <p> Your name comes first . Follow it up with your address , telephone number , and email address . I have seen resumes with absolutely no contact information . My impression ? " This person is way too silly to work for us , " so do n't  forget these basics . <h> Career objective <p> A lot of people skip this part , but its definitely worth including . Be realistic about what you should be aiming for in your career at the moment . Its pointless saying you want to be CEO if you 're applying for an internship . What you want is an internship . Why do you want it ? Keep this to a sentence or two at most . <h> Summary <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get your resume noticed . To write your summary , think about how you would advertise yourself . For example : <p> Marketing professional with 3 years experience <p> Creative thinker <p> Fully conversant with online marketing techniques <p> Strong interpersonal skills <p> Goal-orientated approach <p> Enthusiastic , passionate and energetic <p> Just be sure that you can back up any of these points with practical examples if anyone were to ask you ! If you still lack experience , a little humility does n't  go amiss . You could highlight your positive personal traits and your willingness to learn , for example . <h> Education <p> List your educational achievements from the most recent to the oldest . Say what qualification you achieved , specify which educational institution you attended , and give the date your qualification was awarded . You should attach copies of your certificates in an appendix . <h> Work experience <p> You need to show recruiters how you have spent your time since you achieved your qualifications . Give your most recent job first , and continue in reverse chronological order . Your employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as a header . <p> Recruiters also like to see a contact person and a telephone number here , since it makes it easy for them to verify your experience and get an opinion on how you performed . Provide a summary of what your responsibilities were , starting each one with a verb . <p> You need not give a reason for leaving , but if you 've changed jobs fairly frequently , giving this information can help to overcome bias . So if your first post was an internship , and the second a fixed term contract that could help to explain why you changed jobs twice in two years . Recruiters see red flags when looking at a resume that seems to indicate you 're a butterfly . <h> Optional odds and ends <p> If you have any specific achievements that say something about how you would work in an organization , you could list them under Additional Achievements . So if you won a scholarship or held student leadership positions , these could count in your favor . <p> You may also have attended short courses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in your field . List them under Relevant courses . <p> Other skills that you may have acquired without ever doing a course may be of interest to a recruiter . For example , if you 've mastered important graphics programs and can do graphic design even though you did n't  study in that direction , that may be of interest if you 're applying for a post where your extra skill could come in handy . <p> If you 've done volunteer work , you could also list this since it may indicate your areas of interest and show that you 're a responsible person . <h> Hobbies /Interests <p> This is also an optional extra , but recruiters like to see whether your personality makes you a good fit . Saying you watch TV probably is n't very helpful , but mentioning that you enjoy going to karate class will make them see you as a person of action with a certain amount of self-discipline . <h> Contacts / References <p> Even if you listed your reference contacts along with your work or educational history , you should add a handy guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy as possible for a recruiter to verify the information given in your resume . This may sound like its not that important , but it is . Making the recruiters job easier shows that you will be helpful and make the people you work with lives easier as well , even if its only subconsciously . Its little things like these that often stand out the most . <h> Do n't  forget your appendices <p> Youve done with writing your resume , but do n't  forget to include any reference letters and certifications . Again , this makes it easy for the recruiter to verify your information . Now you 're ready to get that resume out there and knock em dead ! <p> At some point in your writing career , you might be asked ( or need ) to collaborate with someone else on a project . You may co-author a novel together , you may need someone with scientific experience you do n't  have when you write your non-fiction book , or you may need to hire an illustrator for your childrens book . Whatever the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of your careers and result in a great project that neither one of you could complete alone . Or it could be a disaster that makes you question why you ever wanted to write in the first place and drives you to drink . Heavily . To prevent disaster , consider the following before you agree to collaborate with others . <h> Identify why you need/want to collaborate <p> Can you simply not handle the workload alone ? Does your collaborator have information/expertise that you do not ? Do you want to attach this persons name/credibility to your project so that it will seem more respectable ? Figuring out exactly why you want a collaborator is the first step in choosing the best person for the job . Or , you may decide that you really do n't  need a collaborator and decide to skip it altogether . <h> Choose someone you trust <p> This should be obvious . Pick collaborators that you trust . Youll be putting a portion of your writing career in their hands , so choose wisely . A " brand name " collaborator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duration of the project or ruin the project altogether . <h> Clearly assign tasks and deadlines <p> The time to argue about who will do what and when it is due is at the beginning of the project , not midway through . Set forth your expectations and writing deadlines before you begin . Make sure that all partners will be able to handle their parts of the work . Adjustments can be made as needed , but at least begin with a solid framework to avoid disagreements and misunderstandings . <h> Make sure you can communicate <p> Your collaborator should be someone that you are comfortable communicating with . Do n't  choose someone who intimidates you so much that you wo n't speak up , who never returns calls or emails , or who is never available . Successful collaboration requires a lot of communication so you need someone that is available and open . <h> Make sure you fight well <p> At some point , you will fight with your collaborator . Guaranteed . Make sure the person you 're working with is someone that you can fight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stuck with a bully or a sulker . Ideally , you want someone who will work with you to find the compromise position . <h> Specify payment arrangements up front <p> Will you split the payment equally ? Will you split the pay based on the number of hours worked , or amount of words written ? Put whatever arrangements you decide on in writing to prevent problems later . <h> Specify credit arrangements up front <p> Will you share equally in the credit for the work ? Will one of you be the main author with the other relegated to a smaller byline ? Will both of you get bylines at all , or will one person be the ghost writer ? Sort these things out before you begin so feelings are n't  hurt later . <h> What happens if one partner decides to walk away or dies ? <p> While unlikely , there may come a point where one of you says , " That 's it . I 've had enough , " and wants out . Worse , one of you could die . What will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working solo , or will it just be shelved ? Is the remaining partner allowed to choose another partner ? What about any money arrangements that have been made ? Who gets what ? Specify the contingencies in writing . <h> Protect yourself <p> The most important thing when collaborating is to get everything in writing . You hope it never comes to litigation but if it should , you 'll be glad you have the backup . Its not being pushy to insist on contracts , even if your collaborator is your best friend . Its just smart to make sure that everyone is protected and all arrangements are understood . <p> Collaboration can be a lot of fun if its handled well and if it contributes to a better work . It can also be a pain in the butt if partners cant get along or if agreements fall apart . Take these steps before you begin your collaborative project to keep things on the fun side . <p> When it comes to uncommon words , one set that fits that bill are words which end with the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than a couple of words which end in q . The good news is there are likely more of these words than you imagined exist , but the reality is there are n't  a whole lot of them . <p> If you 're searching this question , there 's a good chance you are here because you 're searching for words for Scrabble or other word games . Since there are a number of words that end with a " q " but are n't  allowed in Scrabble , well begin by listing those that cam be played in the game . <h> Words Ending in Q ( Scrabble Allowed ) <p> 3 Letter Words <p> Suq : A variant of the word souk which is another name for a street market in Arab cities . <p> 5 Letter Words <p> Qepiq : A monetary unit used in Azerbaijan : 100 Qepiq is equal to 1 manat.Talaq : A divorce method found within Islamic law.Tranq : An abbreviated form of the word tranquilizer.Umiaq : A boat created by Inuits which is made by stretching animal skins . <p> 7 Letter Words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spiritual leader in the Hebrew language.Tzaddiq : A spelling variation of the word Tsaddiq . <p> While the above are words that can be used in word games like Scrabble , they are n't  the only words that end in the letter " q " . There are a number of place names which end with this letter . Below is a list of places ending in " q " <p> In addition to places , there are a number of abbreviations which end with " q " which may be seen in writing but are n't  allowed to be used in word games like Scrabble . A few of these words follow : <h> Abbreviations Ending in Q <p> CQ : The beginning radio transmission call letters when a message is intended for all receivers.GHQ : An abbreviation for the words " general headquarters " .

If you know of other words missing from this list , please leave a comment so we can add any that should be included . Wed like this to be the most comprehensive list and hope with your help to achieve that goal . <p> Writing a college admissions essay has become a prerequisite for entry to many universities . Its an opportunity for the selection committee to get to know more about you . Writing such an essay tends to be stressful for most applicants . Many will delay writing it , while others will spend days , if not weeks , perfecting their personal statements . <p> It certainly is a challenge summarizing seventeen years of ones life or more into a mere 600 words . You will want to come across as being intelligent and the best candidate without being perceived as arrogant . This post will provide you with valuable advice to help you to make a good impression when writing your college admission essay . <h> The Importance of Your Introduction <p> An important thing to remember is that the admissions officers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of applications to go through . With limited time available to them , its crucial to immediately grab their attention and engage them . <p> One of the best ways to do this is to begin with a personal anecdote . By sharing a moment , you will be able to set the scene . You can reveal how the experience impacted your life and how it helped shape you into the person you are today . Explain how the memory has impacted on your life and explain why it made you choose the study direction in which you wish to proceed . <h> Think Like an Admissions Officer <p> Universities and colleges want candidates who will graduate and go on to become successful people . Having alumni who are making great strides in the world reflects positively on the colleges image . If the majority of students failed and dropped out of their college , this would not be a good advertisement for the educational institution . <p> With this in mind , you 'll want to show that you are a determined individual . You should convey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated and hungry for success . You need to let them know that you 're resourceful and willing to make sacrifices in order to reach your goals . <h> Tone it Down <p> Yes , you want to make an impression . That said , keep it simple . One of the worst mistakes you can make on the admissions essay is to use too much flowery language . Verbosity has its place , but a college admissions essay is not it . Throw away the thesaurus and write using everyday vocabulary . Remember , you are not Shakespeare nor do you need to be . <p> Colleges are flooded with examples of applicants achievements . There is nothing wrong with being proud of your accomplishments , but do bear in mind that this approach tends to be boring . Think outside the box and show some creativity . Blowing your own trumpet too much can make you come across as conceited and arrogant . If your achievement illustrates why you would succeed in your future studies or be a credit to the college , try to mention it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot a fraud is when they are writing about something they have no interest in . You wo n't impress the selection committee if you fake it . Doing so will fail to show authenticity and original thinking . It does n't  matter if you 've never climbed Mount Everest or gone sky diving . What 's far more important is you being able to honestly express your feelings and discoveries . In fact , being able to show this side is likely to be far more impressive to the admission officers than any individual claim you make . That is , its not reaching the top of a mountain that 's important , but being able to honestly detail the process , obstacles and what you learned along the way . <p> Make your essay personal . Show your passion and let your own unique personality shine through . In doing so , you 'll stand a far greater chance of being accepted than if you ramble on about a topic in which you have little experience or zero personal interest . <h> Be Controversial <p> Being controversial may seem like a double-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the lookout for people who can take an intellectual position and argue points according to reason . This does not mean you should simply choose an argument and spout off your own opinions . <p> Do n't  pretend that your line of thinking is absolute and unquestionable . Provide reasons as to why you think this way . Give examples with references to statistics and facts . Include the opinions of recognized intellectuals and above all , never , ever take the side of an extremist radical . There 's a vast difference between an intelligent albeit controversial individual , and being an absolute nut-job who has been brainwashed with hype and propaganda . <h> Fonts and Formats <p> If there are any guidelines provided , then its advisable to stick to them . If you cant follow instructions for an essay , how will you be able to write a dissertation one day ? Keep your font selection clean and easy to read ( remember , the admission officials will be reading hundreds of these ) . Use one standard font throughout . <p> Separate various sections by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bold with major sections identifiable through means of a larger , underlined font size . <h> Last , but not Least <p> You may have written a phenomenal piece . It could contain the very essence of what your admissions officer is looking for . Have you checked it for spelling or grammatical errors ? have you made sure you 're not using the same words too much ? <p> As mentioned previously , admissions officers are under pressure to read numerous applications . In a hypothetical situation , let us assume your application gets reviewed toward the end of a long , rough day . The first thing the officer sees is three spelling mistakes and poor sentence construction in the first paragraph . Chances are your application will be immediately sent to the " Declined " pile . <p> Make sure you proofread your application . Give it to a teacher or parent to read . Spell check it . Make sure it is worthy of you and the time and effort you put into it . <p> There is an art to persuasive writing and many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally to some , for others a little practice may be required . The important thing to remember is that anyone can actually write persuasively , provided they follow a few basic guidelines . <p> A persuasive essay is written to convince the reader to accept a point of view . You may want them to sympathize with your cause or to take a particular course of action . Persuasive essays are often used in advertising and politics . Business proposals , applications for study grants , fundraising , debates etc. are all examples when persuasive writing may be beneficial . People who are good at this style of writing are in high demand . <p> If you are trying to convince someone to side with you , you 'll want to be thoroughly prepared . It does n't  help if you have a list of excellent points but fail to pay attention to the weak arguments . By following the following simple steps , you should be able to come up with a strong case on which to build upon . <h> Planning and Preparation <p> Before you even begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to do the preparation . Every aspect of your essay needs to be considered . Begin with deciding on your stance . Think about why you have chosen this position . What are the motivating factors ? Do you have facts to support your case ? <p> Another important consideration is understanding your audience . Who are they ? Do they have strong opinions , or are they undecided ? What are they looking for and what appeals to them ? The more you can appeal to their needs and interests , the more persuasive you will be . <p> Finally , you need to research , research and do more research . You need to come across as a person who knows what he or she is talking about . If you have your facts wrong , it will weaken , if not destroy , your argument before you even begin . Do n't  rely on just one source . The more information you are armed with , the greater your chances of shooting down any opposition . <h> Style and Structure <p> Any persuasive essay should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is to begin with an introduction . Your introduction needs to immediately grab the readers attention . You should provide a brief overview of your argument and state why your case is worthy of merit . <p> The main body of your persuasive essay will detail the evidence in support of your case . Each section should deal with one piece of information , presented separately . Its important to provide evidence in support of all your facts . <p> Before closing , you should highlight the major points of any counter argument . Again , its essential that you provide evidence that refutes opposition to your stance . You can make use of quotes from experts , can include real life examples or refer to relevant facts and statistics . <p> Your conclusion needs to be a short synopsis of what has already been stated . Your closing sentence should be dramatic . It should leave the audience wanting to take immediate action or to reflect deeply on what you propose . Provide solutions to problems and encourage the reader not to delay . <h> Revision <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the importance of revision . There are a few questions you should ask when revision your essay . Does the essay impart enough information ? You should n't expect your audience to know everything , so the more information you can provide them with will allow them to make an informed decision . Do your points contain compelling evidence in support of your argument ? Making wild , unsubstantiated claims will set you up for failure . Each point of merit needs to be justified . Does the essay follow a logical path ? Are words carefully chosen for maximum impact or is the essay difficult to read with little meaningful information ? Does the essay present the strongest possible argument or does it require more facts ? <h> Editing <p> Once you have finalized your persuasive essay , you need to make sure it is free from any typos , spelling mistakes or grammatical errors . Ask a friend or relative to read through it , and ask them for their point of view . Remember , you 're not trying to convince yourself . You 're trying to convince others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Presentation <p> Once everything is complete you 'll be faced with the task of presenting your essay . Make sure a good , easily readable font is used . Each section should be clearly identifiable with relevant headings . If you 're familiar and well versed with the content of your presentation , there 's no reason why you shouldnt be able to successfully persuade those who read your essay . <p> Titling a book or an article is a tricky thing . There are many considerations . You want it to be catchy but meaningful . You do n't  want the same title that a thousand others have already used . You want it to convey what the work is about without giving away the ending . You do n't  want it to be so long that people give up reading it , nor so short that people have no idea what they 're getting . Many writers find choosing a title to be more difficult and frustrating than revisions . While I cant make it any easier for you to choose your ideal title , I can give you some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Words like " Epic , " " Fantastic , " " Revolutionary , " " Breakthrough , " and " Incredible " are overused and they promise something that your work likely ca n't deliver . You may have a great story , but its doubtful that its truly epic in scale . Its doubtful that your non-fiction book is truly revolutionary , no matter how much you may think so . Readers do n't  like to be lied to , so err on the side of under-promising with your title and then delivering a great piece that exceeds their expectations . Let the critics and reviewers label your book as " Epic " or " Revolutionary " if its deserving of that honor . <h> Try to keep it short <p> Long titles create a host of issues for readers and catalogers . When readers peruse a crowded shelf , long titles often get overlooked . For a long title to fit on a book jacket , the font often has to be smaller and hard to read . A title with a short word count , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long titles may be truncated when viewed online or in databases and they 're hard to turn into good urls . They 're hard to fit on business cards . Long titles are also hard to recommend to friends . " Hey , did you read , Fat Loss , " is a lot easier to say than , " You should check out Get in Shape , Lose Weight , and Lose Fat Through Exercise and Calorie Counting . " <h> But do n't  fear a long title <p> Short may be best , but some books just require a long title . If you choose to go long , make sure you have a good reason for doing so and that you 're not just being lazy or uncreative . <h> Research your choices <p> Before you fall in love with a title , check to see how many other books carry the same title . Its not a deal breaker if other books share your title ( titles ca n't be copyrighted , after all ) , but it becomes more problematic if the book also is in your genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is about flooring will not likely be confused with a novel called , " Floored ! " that 's about a character that receives a big surprise . But you might have a problem if there are two novels titled , " Floored ! " and they are both literary fiction . <h> Consider subtitles <p> Subtitles are used most often in non-fiction . The short , catchy part of the title can be used to lure readers in while the longer subtitle can clarify what the book is actually about . Something like , " Loser : How to Lose Weight By Eating Only Mushrooms , " is an example . Subtitles also work for fiction to differentiate novels in a series . Consider Harry Potter . " Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone . " " Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . " Readers referred to those books as " Harry Potter " or , " The newest Harry Potter , " but the subtitle was there for extra clarification . <h> Get feedback <p> Ask others who have read your work to evaluate your title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , and is something they would pick up in the store . <h> Look to your text <p> Some of the best titles come from lines in the book itself . Maybe its a snippet of dialog or a sentence fragment . If you 're stuck for a title , reread your manuscript and look for anything that might work . <h> Brainstorm <p> If you 're having trouble choosing a title , brainstorm . Make lists of words that seem relevant . Try arranging those words in various orders . Look at other titles in your genre and see what works and what does n't  . Write long , ridiculous titles and then try to shorten them . Just write down everything that comes to you and keep massaging it until you hit gold . <h> Know what your writing about <p> This seems obvious , but you 'd be surprised how many people cant summarize their book in one or two sentences because they really have no idea what they were trying to say . The book is a rambling mess and the title is , too . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information you 're trying to convey , or the story you 're trying to tell , its much easier to create a title . <h> Wait until you 're finished <p> A corollary to the above is to wait to choose the title until you 're finished writing the book . The books focus or tone might change over time . You do n't  want to fall in love with a title at the beginning that no longer fits when you 're finished . When the book is finished , you 'll have a much better idea of what you want the title to convey . <h> Avoid cliches and overused titles <p> " The Adventures of , " " Tales of , " " The Art of , " " The Joy of , " and " The Chronicles of , " are all examples of overused and cliche titles . Your book may be an adventure or convey the joy of something , but find another title . <h> Do n't  get weird or cute unless you can do it well <p> Some people make up a word and use it as the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to stardom . They hope that people will run around parroting the title , " Gerflunkamuggin , " at each other . The problem is , if the title makes no sense or is unpronounceable , readers wont go for it . Similarly , some people try to create a pun or alliterative title that falls flat . Cute can work , but it has to be done well . <h> Go against advice <p> Advice is just advice . There are still cliches that become bestsellers . There are short titles that no one remembers and long ones that people fall in love with . If the book is great and the title in some way conveys that , it might succeed no matter how weird , long , short , or cliched it is . <h> Do n't  give away the ending <p> You want your readers to buy your book and they wo n't do that if the title has already told them how it ends or what the big surprise is . Give them an idea of what the book is about with your title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  fall in love <p> No matter how much work you put into choosing your title , the fact is an editor or publisher may change it for any number of reasons . Be willing to listen to what they say and be open to changing it . Do n't  cling so stubbornly to a title that you alienate a publisher . <p> Titling a book is never going to be easy , but careful thought and experimentation can yield a good result . Think of it like naming a baby . You want something that fits well with the book , that other people wont make fun of , and which will still sound good and make sense forty years from now . <p> Unless you 're super famous or your publisher has big dreams for your book , you probably wont be given your own , paid-for book tour . If you 're self-published , you do n't  even have a chance of having someone pay you to tour . Not getting an all expense paid book tour is n't a necessarily a reflection of your writing , but more if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a book tour , what do you do , then ? <p> You go it alone and set up your own tour . Before you decide to go on the road , though , you must decide whether the expense is worth it . Will you generate enough exposure and sales to offset the costs of the tour , or would you be better served by finding some other ways to promote your work ? If you 're still set on going on tour , here are some tips for organizing your own tour . <h> Establish a budget <p> Its important to establish a budget and to look for ways to cut costs . Figure out how much you can spend and allocate that money most effectively . You probably wont be able to visit every city you want to visit , so choose which places will give you the most bang for your buck . Also , look into staying with friends or family to cut costs , or doing a tour of places that are within driving distance of your home to avoid expensive airfare . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope theyll let you read . Send out copies to bookstores and other places beforehand to gauge interest . If someone writes back and says , " This book is n't for us , " you can mark that off your list and not waste money going there . If they are interested , you can follow up and add them to your list of places to visit . <h> Consider teaming with another writer <p> If you know another writer in your field or whose work is similar to yours , consider teaming up . A bookstore may be more willing to have two of you appear rather than just taking a chance on one unknown author . If your teammate has some credibility already , so much the better . If you trust and are friendly with the other writer , you may be able to share hotel rooms and rental cars , reducing the costs for you both . <h> Do n't  limit yourself to bookstores <p> Bookstores are n't  the only places where you can appear . Conventions and conferences that are about your field or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your book is set in a certain location you might try tourism boards or similar places . There are also libraries , community centers , senior centers , book clubs , and schools/universities if your material is applicable . <h> Think beyond a standard reading <p> If you can teach a class in something or speak about your topic , pitch yourself as a speaker rather than just a reader or book signer If a store can bill your event as a learning opportunity they may be more willing to have you visit than if you simply plan to read from your book ( which no one has heard of ) . You 're often more valuable as an educator than an author . <h> Consider a virtual book tour <p> If you do n't  have the money to do a regular tour , you can consider a virtual tour . You connect with book bloggers around the country and agree to write guest posts , run some giveaways , do a podcast , and/or take questions from readers . You can also do virtual chats or readings through Skype or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on your part , but it costs very little . <h> Go where people know you <p> If you do n't  know a soul in New York , it might not be worth going there . Think of places where you know people who can help you . Where did you go to school ? Can you go back to your hometown ? Do you have a lot of friends living in one city ? Go places where your friends and family can help get the word out and drive people to your event . <h> Practice efficient scheduling <p> Once you figure out where you 're going , organize your schedule for efficiency . You do n't  want to be flying back and forth across the country ten times . Proceed from city to city in a logical and cost effective order . <h> Practice your pitch <p> When you 're ready to start calling bookstores and other places to set up your appearance times , be prepared . Do n't  wing it . Know who you 're calling ( find out who handles events and ask for that person ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be clear on who you are and what you 're offering ( a reading , a class , etc . ) Be professional . If you go in unprepared , or ask , " Um , what do other authors do ? " the other person is likely to dismiss you . Quickly . <h> Alert the media <p> Call local newspapers and other media in the cities you 'll be visiting to see if you can wrangle any coverage of your time in their city . You may not get any interest , but then again you might so its worth a try . <h> Pay attention to the logistics <p> Make sure your books are shipped to each location with time to spare before you appear . Will you have to ship other promotional items , as well ? Know how you will get around each city . Should you get lodgings with a kitchen to save money , or are there reasonably priced eateries nearby ? Are you leaving enough time between appearances to deal with transportation or weather delays ? There are plenty of details to consider besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to organize your own book tour , even within tight budget constraints . To maximize your investment , do some advance planning and research and make sure that touring will give you the return you expect or need . Touring is n't the end all , be all . There are lots of other ways to promote your work . Touring can be fun or it can be a nightmare . Try to prepare as much as you can in advance to prevent the nightmare scenario . 
@@12747297 @1347297/ <h> Stumbling into a Freelance Writing Career <p> When people find out that I 'm a freelance writer , one of the first things they want to know is , " How did you get into that ? " Sometimes its just passing curiosity . Other times they want to know because they aspire to quit working for " the man " and go out on their own and writing seems like an easy way to do that . ( Before I continue this story , let me tell you that it is n't an easy way to make a living . Sure , I work from home , but I have deadlines and responsibilities just like any other profession . I also get the joy of handling all of my own marketing , accounting , taxes , and office expenses , whereas someone else handled all of that when I was working for " the man . " So if you think being a freelance writer is all easy and fun , think again . Its a job just like any other job . ) <p> Anyway , people always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was following when I decided to become a freelance writer . They want my roadmap so that they can follow it , too . The thing is , I never had a definite roadmap and I have n't met very many freelance writers who did . Its rare to find someone who came out of college saying , " Yeah , I 'm going to be a freelance writer ! " At best you might find a freelance writer who came out of college saying , " Yeah , I 'm going to be a journalist or PR person , " who then stumbled into freelancing after putting in a few years in the corporate world . Those of us who had road maps are rare . Most of us just sort of fell into the occupation , but that 's not a bad thing . <p> If you want to know how it happened to me , here 's the story : I came out of college with a degree in " Communication . " Not quite as useless as a degree in Philosophy , but close . I 'm still not even sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an administrative assistant at a small software company . Fortunately , it was n't long before the company discovered that I had some ability with words , layout , and design and put me to work writing and designing some brochures . Next thing I knew , I was writing marketing materials , too . I got really lucky when one of the writers in the software department quit and I got tasked with writing online help files . I also got to write grant proposals and , once the infant Internet came to town , I got to write the website copy . If it needed words , it seemed to find its way to my desk . That 's the benefit of a small company . You can be asked to do anything and everything , building skills as you go along . <p> Unfortunately , the company was a horror show . I eventually found another job . I was actually hired as a " Technical Writer " at that company where I stayed for another couple of years gaining experience and practicing my skills . ( Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite my job title . I just knew that somehow all these projects involved writing . I still wasnt thinking in terms of making writing a career . It was just a job . ) <p> When I was laid off ( thank you , dot-com bust ) , I had a little time to think about what to do next . I could go and look for another technical writing job or I could do something else . Coincidentally , one of the people from my old job also had his own consulting business on the side . He called and asked if I 'd help him with some promotional materials . I did . Then he asked if I 'd help him with a consulting job that he had . He had the software end under control but needed someone to write the online help files . I did . When a friend of his asked for help with his website , he referred him to me . I helped him , too . All the while I was getting paid for all this " helping , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " real job , " even after I accounted for taxes . <p> It was about six months later that the light bulb went on .

I was in business ! A career was born and the rest is history . Ive been flying solo now for about fourteen years and its been great . Its still a little weird to think of myself as a freelance writer , but there are n't  any other words for what I do . <p> So what 's the moral of my little story ? If you want to be a freelance writer it might be easier than you think . Of course , you have to have an ability with words . And you have to be disciplined and organized enough that you impress your first clients ( referrals are really helpful ) . But you do n't  really have to set out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not a career that 's closed to you if you did n't  get the right degree or the right first job .

It might happen when you 're young or when you 're retired and looking for something to do . Being a freelance writer is n't restricted to those " in the know " or who got an MFA . Articles , manuals , reports , guidelines , brochures , etc. are needed in every field . If you can write , you can carve out a niche for yourself . <p> Most writers tell stories similar to mine .

@@12747299 @1347299/ <h> 27 Ways to Beat Writers Procrastination <p> Procrastination can be a problem for many writers . For some , it can become a habit that 's hard to break and which has the potential to derail your writing career . Its not that you do n't  need/want to work , but you keep coming up with a thousand other things that either have to be done right now , or which seem like a better alternative than writing . They may also simply be excuses . Then , before you know it , the day is over and you have n't written a word . <p> String enough of these days together and you start to find yourself locked in a vicious cycle . You know you should be writing but you 're not , that makes you depressed or angry so you do n't  want to write , so you go find something else to do like watch bad reality TV and eat chips . Maybe you miss a few deadlines due to your procrastination and either lose some work or end up rushing to finish something , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeats until you give up , decide its not meant to be , and go to work at the Zippy Mart . <p> I exaggerate , of course . ( well , sort of ) . The good news is that ( in the absence of a true mental illness ) procrastination can usually be cured by honing your awareness of the problem , using your common sense , and employing good time management skills . Here are twenty-seven ideas to help you overcome your procrastination habit . <h> Do n't  wait for the muse <p> Many writers say things like , " I 'm not inspired just now , " or , " When the muse strikes , I 'll really put in the effort . " Newsflash : The muse is a fairy tale . Rarely does inspiration come out of nowhere . Usually its the result of some work on your part , like doing some freewriting , buckling down and researching your next article , or drafting something that you know is crap but which you intend to rework later . If you wait for the muse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start working on something . Anything . That will get the creative juices flowing and lead to more inspiration . <h> Do n't  wait for perfect conditions <p> " I 'll write when the kids are quiet . " " I 'll write when insert crisis is over . " " I 'll write when I 'm retired . " " I 'll write once I get my office renovated . " Any of this sound familiar ? If so , you could be guilty of waiting for ideal conditions in which to write . However , ideal conditions almost never happen . There 's always something going on , something going wrong , something ( or someone ) annoying you , and demands on your time . Thats life . If you want to make writing a priority in your life then you cant wait for perfect conditions . You just have to deal with whatever else is going on and write , too . You do this for other things you 've identified as priorities in your life , so why not writing ? <h> Set a timer <p> Buy an egg timer , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your stove . Set the timer for the minimum amount of time you 're willing to commit to writing right now . It may be fifteen minutes , thirty minutes , or an hour . Then put your butt in the chair and write until the timer goes off . If you 're into it by then ( which you probably will be ) , keep going . If you really want to quit you can do so , secure in the knowledge that you did something semi-productive today . <h> Set a goal <p> If you do n't  like writing with a timer , try a page or word count goal instead . If you need to focus on research , set a goal to call one source , or look up three facts . Once the goal is met , you can quit if you wish or keep going . <h> Keep an appointment <p> Some people work better when they have the formality of an appointment to keep . If that 's you , note in your calendar that you will be writing from 7 PM 9 PM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Become an " X " Man ( or Woman ) <p> Every day that you write and do the work youre supposed to do , make an " X " ( or smiley face , or star , etc. ) on your calendar . After a while , you have a lovely string of Xs . You 're less tempted to skip a day at that point because it stinks to mess up such a pretty string of success . <h> Make it a habit <p> The point of numbers three through six , above , is to help make writing a habit . Research consistently shows that once something is a habit , you do it with little effort or angst . You simply do what you need to do and rarely do you skip it . You do n't  spend an hour trying to decide whether you should shower or brush your teeth today , or decide to do something else instead of showering ( I hope ) because you just cant bring yourself to turn on the water . You just do it . Make writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sometimes having a pre-writing ritual can help move your brain into work mode when it really wants to go take a nap . Maybe you sit down and sharpen your pencil . Maybe you freewrite for ten minutes before the " real " work begins . Maybe you get a glass of water in your favorite glass and set it on your desk before beginning work . Whatever it is , your ritual is something you do every time you get ready to write . After a while , your brain and body know that if the ritual is taking place , its time to get to work . <h> Keep multiple projects going at once <p> Sometimes procrastination is born out of boredom or being stuck on a project . This is why keeping multiple projects going at once can be helpful . If you become bored or stuck on your novel , for example , you can switch over and work on your short story or that article you want to pitch to your favorite magazine . If you only have one thing going , its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and break out the XBox . <h> Have someone check up on you <p> Accountability can do wonders for curing procrastination . Have a friend agree to call you at a certain time and ask you how much work you 've done , or join a writers group that expects to see progress at each meeting . Sure , you could just lie and say , " Oh , I wrote thirty pages today , " but inside you 're going to feel like crap if you do . And if you 're honest and say , " I played video games all afternoon instead of writing , " you 're going to be ashamed . Actually working will alleviate both feelings . <h> Find a role model <p> If you have trouble getting down to work , find someone who does n't  and make them your writing buddy . You can both go to the library or the coffee shop to work . If the other person is working diligently , chances are you wo n't want to look like a slacker in comparison . <h> Go somewhere else <p> If working at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance , cleaning , etc. ) , go to the library . If the coffee shop is too full of friends or cool things to waste time with , stop trying to be a hipster and just go home . If you 're having trouble getting to work where you are , find a better place . <h> Plan tomorrow before you quit today <p> Write down what you need to do tomorrow , set a starting time , and note any other information to help you get started the next day . Rather than sitting at the computer wondering what to do ( and then surfing Pinterest when you ca n't figure it out ) , you 'll know what to do and can immediately get to it . <h> Practice and learn <p> Sometimes you are n't  skilled enough to tackle the project at hand and , rather than admit it , its easier to procrastinate . This tends to happen when you take on a project in an industry that you are n't  familiar with , or when you take on your first project of a given type . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do one for your favorite client , for example . But you can learn to do almost anything . Rather than procrastinating , get to work learning about this new thing you 've signed up for . Learn the rules and formats required , read examples of others work , and practice until you 've got a feel for it . <h> Eliminate unnecessary tasks <p> Sometimes , when you have too much to do , your brain just says , " No , thanks , " and shuts down . This can lead to procrastination as you piddle around trying to figure out which thing to do first , or how you 're going to fit everything into the day . Say , " No , " to anything that is n't essential . Delegate anything you can to someone else . Do n't  take on an obligation if you know its going to cut into your writing time and you do n't  have to do it . Schedule appointments for times other than your prime writing time . The more you can reduce the demands on your time , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time <p> While its great to clear your calendar so you can write more , some people find that having too much time is worse than having none at all . When I first quit my job and started working from home as a full-time writer , I had a lot more time . Days stretched before me with no meetings , no set times for arrival or departure , and no commute . I could do as I chose and I often chose nothing . There 's an illusion with too much time that you can always get to it " later . " Since you 're not pressed for time , you can write anytime , right ? But you often do n't  . I overcame it using many of the strategies listed here , but I learned that having too much time can be as bad as being stretched to the limit . <h> Get organized and stay that way <p> Its easy to procrastinate by filing , cleaning up the desk , or putting away reference materials . But this is just another way to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate a day to cleaning it up , devising a workable filing system , and making sure that everything you need is easy to hand . Then keep it that way . Now you have no excuse for not writing because everything is in its place and easy to find . <h> Get over perfectionism <p> The thought that you have to be perfect can freeze you where you stand . If you ca n't be perfect , you think , why bother ? Its easier to go clean the house or trawl Facebook than to write crap . Nobodys perfect . Let it go and just do the best you can on any given day . If the days work is bad you can always fix it later , but get at least something down on the paper . <h> Break the project down <p> Rather than tackling a project all at once ( which can seem overwhelming and lead to procrastination ) , break it down into smaller chunks . Focus on outlining just one chapter , for example , or writing one section of a book proposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its not that you do n't  want to write , its that you 're afraid to write . You 're afraid of rejection , of failure , of what your friends or family will think , or even of success ( it happens ) . If you admit your fear and deal with it , the procrastination may go away . <h> Turn off/ignore all distractions <p> You know how it goes . You answer the phone , only to be caught talking to your mother for an hour . Instead of saying , " I 'll call you back in two hours , " you actually think , " Thank goodness . Now I do n't  have to work . " You let the distraction lead you down the path of procrastination . To prevent this , turn off the phone , get some noise canceling headphones , refuse to answer the door , etc . Also , if you can , turn off your Internet while you 're working .

There are books and classes on the subject if you need to improve your skill . <h> Find the motivation <p> If a project is n't due for months , or its a big project like a book , its hard to find motivation day in and day out .

If you need to interrupt your writing , do so quickly and then get back to it . Better yet , make a note of what you need to know and keep on writing . You can do your " research " later . <h> Reward yourself <p> If you do what youre supposed to do on a given day ( and be honest here ) , give yourself a small reward . It does n't  have to be expensive . Maybe one song download from iTunes , a sticker on your calendar , or a favorite snack . Rewards may not make the task any easier , but knowing that you 'll get something fun at the end can motivate you to put your butt in the chair . <h> Ask yourself if you really want to be a writer <p> If procrastination ca n't be overcome , it might be time to ask yourself if you really want to write . Maybe you are really trying to fill someone elses expectations , or to do a job that you heard was " great " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its better to admit that writing is n't for you than to struggle every day . <p> Many things can cause procrastination and discovering why youre dragging your feet to your desk is usually the first step in overcoming the problem . If you already know why youre procrastinating , then taking some active steps to stop it can help you get to work . Procrastination is one of those things that always seems like a good ( or at least harmless ) idea at the time , but which just leads to problems later on . <h> 4 comments <p> Thank you for this very informative article , what struck me are number one ( Do n't  wait for muse ) and number two ( do n't  wait for perfect condition .

@@12747300 @1347300/ <h> Set Aside Time to Write in the Morning : 1000 Words a Day <p> Anyone who wants to be successful at writing 1000 words a day for an extended period of time will have to put aside time each time to reach that goal . The question becomes , when is the best time to set aside writing time each day ? While many will say to set the time aside when you enjoy writing most , Ive come to the conclusion that 's not necessarily the best approach when you are trying to increase your writing productivity . <p> As I mentioned earlier , I take a walk each morning which is an important aspect enabling me to be a productive writer . Upon my return each morning , I sit down to do a minimum of an hour , and as much as 3 hours of writing . The actual amount of time I have each day to write depends on what other things I have to do , but I make sure I have that minimum of an hour to write each morning . Since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head during the morning walk , I usually can hit my 1000 words during that hour . <p> I think its important to set aside time in the morning to write even if you do n't  happen to be a morning writer . I feel I can make this claim because I 'm definitely not naturally a morning writer . I used to do all my writing late at night , and I still do a good amount of my writing during the evening hours . What I 've discovered over time , however , is if I only set aside time in the evening to write , I fail to reach my writing goal much more often than if I set aside time in the morning . <p> There is a simple reason its important to put aside time in the morning if you want to be successful writing a certain number of words on an ongoing basis . Life happens . There will always be unexpected events which will make it impossible for you to write during your designated time no matter how faithfully you plan . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't yet established it as a routine . It takes time to carve out a specific period of time each day that 's devoted solely to writing , and one should expect hiccups while in the process of establishing this time ( and even afterward , although not as often ) . <p> When something happens and I 'm not able to write during my planned time in the morning , I immediately realize I missed the time I was supposed to writing . I instantly begin to figure out when I can make up that time and squeeze in writing so I can still reach my 1000 word goal . I have the rest of the day to make up for the unforeseen event and still reach my goal . <p> When I was writing in the evenings , if something unexpected happened , it was much more difficult to make up for life impeding on my writing . There just is n't enough extra time in the day to reschedule for missed time when its already in the evening , and the day is almost over . Due to the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you a much better chance to reach your word count goal when you take up a challenge . <p> Another huge factor that came into play for me is energy level . The amount of energy I have at the end of the day depends on a lot of factors which happen during the day that are n't  always in my control . The result was that even when I had the time set aside , I was more likely to be tired . Many times I did n't  have the energy to concentrate on my writing the way I should so even when I was writing , the quality was n't necessarily the best . <p> If you 're not a person who usually writes in the morning , this change will be difficult . I know because of how difficult it was for me to adjust . Even today , I do n't  feel as comfortable writing in the morning as I do at night , but Ive gotten a lot better at it over time . More importantly , I have seen how much more productive I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than toward the end . <p> For anyone who has the goal of writing 1000 ( or more ) words a day , its worthwhile taking the time to figure out how to set aside time in the morning . That does n't  mean you cant write in the evenings as well . I still do on a regular basis , and as I 've stated above , I actually enjoy writing in the evening more than I do in the morning . Creating morning writing time will greatly increase your chances of hitting your word count goal each day . 
@@12747301 @1347301/ <h> 1000 Words a Day Writing Challenge <p> If you find yourself in a position where you are n't  writing as much as you would like to , a great way to push yourself to do more is to do a 1000-words-a-day challenge . The actual number of words you choose to try to write daily does n't  have to be 1000 . It can be any number that fits your writing goal , and it can be higher or lower depending on your circumstances . 1000 words a day is a good starting numner if you are n't  sure how much you have been writing . <p> If you have taken one of these challenges in the past , you may not have managed to complete it . What often happens is a writer sets a daily goal , but something happens one day which prevents them from achieving the number of words they set . They then try to make up for the words they failed to write the previous day in addition to their normal daily goal . The result is many get behind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past days and quit . This is a complete shame because , in many cases , they were still writing more than they were before the challenge , just not their predetermined goal . <p> There is a simple solution to this which will greatly increase your chances of completing the challenge without quitting in the middle . In addition to your daily goal , you want to set an absolute minimum number of words you will write each day . A good number for this is 10% of you daily word goal . For example , if you want to write 1000 words a day , the absolute minimum you will write in a day would be 100 words . While this may seem like a silly little thing , it can make a huge difference when it comes to the way you process the challenge . <p> The biggest change is that it redefines failure . Instead of failing by not writing 1000 words , you only fail if you do n't  write 100 words . If you cant write 100 words one day during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You either are n't  truly committed to writing 1000 words a day , or 1000 words a day is too ambitious a goal for you . <p> The 100-word minimum is a failsafe . Again , if you are barely making 100 words each day , then your original goal of 1000 was unrealistic . This minimum should only come into play when something unexpected happens to prevent you from writing , not because of writers block . What it allows you to do is to be disappointed you did n't  reach 1000 words one day without thinking you failed the overall challenge . It also means you do n't  have to make up the words the next day . It keeps the challenge going instead of giving you an excuse to quit . <p> So why have a daily minimum number of words at all ? Having that daily minimum number means that no matter how hectic a day may get , you have made writing a big enough priority that somehow , someway , you 'll find 10 minutes to sit down to write those 100 words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of having days where you do n't  write at all , and reinforce the habit that no matter what , you will write at least a little bit each and every day . This will help to reinforce the fact that writing is a priority in your life , and something you are determined to do on a daily basis . <p> Below are the steps you need to take to set up your challenge : <p> Step one : Determine the goal of how many words you want to write each day . <p> Step two : Determine the minimum number of words you must write each day ( 10% of your goal amount is a good number ) . <p> Step three : Determine the length of the challenge . It could be a month , 100 days , six months or a year whatever best fits your circumstances . If you are trying this for the first time , a month is a good place to begin . <p> Step four : Determine if there are any off days . Some people may not have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day each week . Again , make the challenge fit best to your particular circumstances . <p> Step five : Let others know about the challenge to keep yourself honest . When you let others know you are attempting a challenge , even if its only your family , you usually make a more concerted commitment , and hold yourself more accountable , than if you do n't  tell anyone else . its harder to quit when you 've stated to others what you 're going to do . <p> Step six : Keep track of your daily word count throughout the challenge , and record it somewhere . If you 're truly committed to reaching your daily word count goal , you 'll find the challenge will greatly increase the amount you 're able to write on a daily basis , and over the length of the entire challenge . <h> 4 comments <p> This is a great challenge for me to try . I need to get all the ideas in my head down on paper , and this might motivate me to actually do it . It would be great if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would help me write my novel in no time . Thank you for the inspiration . <p> This is a great challenge for up and coming writers . It will also help improve writing speed and creativity . 1000 words might sound like a lot , but its actually a number that can be written quite quickly once you get the hang of it . <p> When you start out 1000 words sound like an impossible number , but once you chose your topic and start writing it is so easy to complete this challenge . The hardest part of writing is beginning . Once you begin , it becomes a lot easier . Do n't  think about it and just do it . This is a great challenge and so much fun .

@@12747304 @1347304/ <h> Using the Sims to Facilitate Writing <p> I confess : I 'm a huge fan of the computer game , The Sims . I 've played it since the first iteration and have spent an embarrassing amount of money and time on the game . It used to be a guilty pleasure until I discovered that I could use it to further my writing . I could play and work at the same time ! ( Well , sort of . ) <p> The Sims let 's me quickly create characters and let them live through situations ( well , most of the time they live , sometimes they die ) that would take me weeks of outlining to accomplish . I can experiment with various personality traits . I can give them jobs ( they can even be writers ) , let them run their own business , keep them unemployed , or get them fired or promoted at work . They can be criminals or good guys . I can make them rich , or keep them poor . I can make them happy or mad . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or homosexual ) , leave them unattached , or I can make their relationships go bust . They can even have affairs . I can give them pets or kids . Heck , in the latest iteration of the game I can even experiment with zombies , vampires , and witches and even send my Sims into the future or off to college . All of this is fodder for my creativity and stories . <p> More than once Ive created a character and let them go about their business with very little assistance from me , just to see what theyd do . Ive taken notes and used their actions and reactions in my work . If things get completely out of control , I can just exit the game without saving and go back to a time when things were better . That 's hard to do after you 've spent a hundred pages going down the wrong path in a novel . Even better , I can save a pristine version of my character and use him or her over and over again in new games to create new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and write about it . That 's a lot easier than working through four or five stories on paper . <p> The Sims is a great way to spark my creativity when its at a low ebb . Sure , I still sit down with paper and pencil and sketch out characters and novel ideas . There are some things a computer game can never address , after all . But it is fun and different and it goes beyond just superficial details like looks and jobs . For example , I can create characters that are " made for " another character , or I can create characters that I know are going to antagonize or even hurt other characters . ( These can later become supporting characters in a novel . ) I can reform bad characters , or make good characters go bad . And then I can sit back and see what happens without having to slog through pages and pages only to discover that it was n't such a great idea after all . <p> I 've even taken some of my characters and their stories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simmers give their input as to what the character should do next . Its amazing what other people think of and getting their input expands my work even further . I can also take characters that others have created and add them to my game , creating even more mayhem . In a way , its a form of fan fiction that spills over into " real " the novels and stories that I 'm working on . <p> Even if you do n't  use it for your " serious " writing , The Sims can be a big help during NaNoWriMo ( National Novel Writing Month ) if you participate . When you get stuck , just boot up the game and play for a while ( but not too long or you 'll waste too much time ) . You 'll quickly have lots of fodder for your story that will push you toward that 50,000-word goal . <p> If The Sims is n't your thing , or if you need more of a fantasy element for your character creation , there are other options . There are plenty of MMORPGs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can try traditional paper and pencil role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder . <p> Okay , so The Sims is never going to qualify for a tax deduction as a " business related expense . " But it has helped my creativity and given me a chance to explore new characters and situations while having some fun in the process . I just have to be careful not to spend too much time with the game because then it just becomes a tool for procrastination . <h> 2 comments <p> Agreed ! Speaking as a custom content addict , Sims 2 was the best in terms of graphics in my opinion but the later iterations have latched onto something great with the traits option . I wan na start a YouTube channel to feature some of my favourite families ! <p> Thank you so much for writing this ! Now I have not only validation for an obsession not many people get , but I also have proof that endless hours of playing with my pixel dollies is actually time spent feeding my muse .

I know because I am one of those people . <p> You cant make money writing greeting cards . I hate when I see this as an option . All greeting card companies have in-house staff to write . You cant just come up with a single idea and pitch it . Do n't  waste your time trying to do this . Its not realistic . <p> This is a very nice post for people who would like to start to make money as there are so many possibilities when it comes to writing . Its definitely a great way to start to make some extra money . That 's my plan ! <p> I have a PhD in biology , and now I wish to switch to writing . I feel that I could be a great technical writer , in any field , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical writer demands a degree in technical writing , or at least in journalism or something similar . <p> I have a feeling that 30 years ago it was n't quite like that . Nowadays there are degrees for everything . I also have a feeling that while in the USA employers might be more flexible and daring and might actually take someone like me , here in strict , buttoned-up Europe nobodys gon na look twice in my direction . <p> The solution might be freelancing , but obviously companies that advertise technical-writer positions do n't  also employ freelancers ; and if they do sometimes offer an assignment on Freelance.com , they pay less than minimum wage ( as was widely discussed here ) . <p> Its to take some work and sacrifice on your part , but its doable . What you 're going to have to do is prove yourself , and that may entail writing for a lot less than you should be getting until you show that your writing is superior . Since you do n't  have the degree that people want , you 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . Nobody is going to just accept your word on it . You 're going to have to show them , and that may be taking on a job without a guaranteed payment . That 's what I did to break it . <p> I basically said that even though I did n't  have the journalism degree , I could do the job and to prove it I said that I would do it and if they werent satisfied , I would n't take any pay for it . It was risky and I ended up doing a lot of work for free because of some kind of shady companies , but in the end it worked out well . I wouldve never wanted to work long term for any of the shady companies , and when I found the quality company that valued my writing skill , I found myself in a very good position . <p> It takes time and work and you 're going to have to get a bit creative to even get the chance to write , but if this is something that you really want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest barriers writers have to be successful is the thought that writing has to be a certain way . As this list shows , there are many different ways that you can use your writing skills to make money . Most writers only think about writing a novel . If you pigeonhole yourself to that one thing , its going to be much more difficult to make a living as a writer . Most people do n't  think about all the other areas where you can make money writing , you 're much more likely To have success in these areas . Making a living as a writer is possible if you 're willing to be flexible on what your image of writing is . <p> The thing that people need to remember is that when you want to make money with your writing , writing becomes a job . That means that you do n't  get to write only when you feel the urge to write . You need to write consistently on a daily basis just like you would go to work and do any other job . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , you need to treat it as a job , not a hobby . Sure , there are exceptions to the rule , but there are also people who make money by winning the lottery . It happens , but its not a viable option for the vast majority of people . If you want to make money as a writer , you need to treat writing as a job . <p> " I make a huge amount of money writing . Its easy and all you have to do is buy my program and I 'll show you how to do it too ! " <p> If you ever see anything like that on the Internet , its a sure sign its a scam . There is no " easy " way to make a lot of money writing . It takes a lot of work and time . Just like any other business or profession , <p> Writing is like any other job . There are a lot of different ways to make money at it , but you need to approach it as a job . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write as a job , but treat it as a hobby . If you are going to make money writing , you have to commit to doing it and treat it as a job . <p> Everyone wants to make money as a writer , but only those who are truly talented can do it . You cant expect to be a famous writer without talent . I have that talent and one day you 'll all know my name . 
@@12747306 @1347306/ <h> 10 Common Writing Submission Mistakes <p> Writers are sometimes their own worst enemies . We complain endlessly about being unable to get published or make money , but yet its often the case that were sabotaging our own success . Sure , sometimes you get rejected because your writing is n't good enough . But often rejections happen because you made a mistake at the submission level and the gatekeeper turned you down before ever reading your work . <p> Remember that editors , agents , and hiring managers are swamped . They get tons of submissions every day . To quickly cull the pile , they look for any obvious reason to discount your submission . That may be something as simple as a misplaced comma or a misspelled name . You do n't  want to go out this way . You want your recipient to at least read your work and then debate its merit , not dump you on the reject pile before the first sentence is even read . With that in mind , here are some common mistakes that writers make when submitting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it a story , letter , resume , article , or full manuscript , make certain that it is error-free . You 're asking someone to trust that you are a competent writer , yet if the first page has the word " Youre " in a situation where the word " Your " should have been used , you 're not coming across as competent . Always look to improve your writing so that there are no mistakes with it . <h> Submitting to the Wrong Person or Place <p> Do n't  submit to houses or agents that do n't  handle your type of work . Do n't  submit to Editor A and Editor B at the same publishing house . Do n't  address Mrs. Smith as Mr. Smith . ( If you 're unclear on gender , a quick phone call to check is fine . ) Do n't  submit to the department manager if you 're supposed to go through human resources . Figure out exactly who should receive your work and send it directly to that person or department . <h> Mass and Blind Submissions <p> Its irritating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers . Such submissions often read , " Dear Sir or Madam , " and then proceed to describe , in very generic terms , why this person should accept your work . Its efficient , but the problem is that your recipients do n't  want to be part of a herd . They want to know why you chose them . They want to know who referred you , or to which ad you are responding . They want to know how you learned of them and why they are the best fit for your work . They want you to demonstrate that you 've done some basic research into who they are and what they represent . Mass submissions are impersonal and only demonstrate that you know how to use the multiple recipient functions in your email program . <h> Failure to Follow Convention <p> Yes , convention can stifle creativity . However , every field has its norms that must be followed . You have to demonstrate that you understand the rules of the " club " and that you can follow them . If convention dictates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you disqualified . If a certain format is required , youd better follow it . Breaking convention wont get you accepted , it will get you rejected . <h> Sending Dirty Work <p> No , I do n't  mean pornography . I mean work that 's stained , crumpled , or torn . In this day and age of quick printing and copying , there 's no excuse for sending out anything other than pristine pages . <h> Looking Like a Paranoid Amateur <p> Many writers submit work with copyright symbols on it , or mentioning in the query letter that the submission should not be shared or forwarded for fear of idea theft . Similarly , do n't  be vague about your work because you 're afraid it will be stolen . " I have a great idea , but I cant share it with you until you commit to publication , " is ridiculous . This is n't the way copyright works and no legitimate publisher or agent is out to steal your work . You 're only coming across as paranoid and no one wants to work with a nutcase . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recipient asks for . No more , no less . Send only whats requested in only the format in which is it requested . Do not send snail mail if only email submissions are accepted , or vice versa . Doing exactly what is asked of you demonstrates that you can follow directions . To a gatekeeper , this increases the chances that you are someone they want to work with , not someone who is going to cause problems during every step of the process . <h> Failure to Include Contact Information <p> No matter how much someone likes your work , you 're going on the rejection pile if they cant easily respond to you . They are n't  going to send a sherpa and a yak out to track you down . They do n't  have time for that . Be sure to include your name , address , phone number , and email address . <h> Overpacking <p> Yes , you want your submission to arrive safely . But you do n't  want to use so much tape that someone has to hack into the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use packing peanuts that will explode all over someones office . Having to exert too much effort to get to your work means that the reader is already frustrated with you when they sit down to read your work . ( Assuming they even bothered . Make it too difficult to get into a package and it might go in the trash unopened . ) Keep the packaging to a minimum . <h> Failure to Properly Check Email Submissions <p> Email submissions are convenient , but they pose potential problems . If you 're asked to attach a file , make sure you 're attaching the correct one . No one wants to read your tax return when they thought they were getting your first chapter . If you 're using a submission page on a website , make sure you 're putting the right information into the right boxes . If you 're copying and pasting into an email or submission site , make sure you 're doing so correctly . You do n't  want things to end up out of order , or discover that you pasted from the last draft of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't  use " Reply All " if you only mean to reply to one person and make certain you 've got the correct recipient(s) in the address section . Double check everything before you hit the Send button . <p> You want to be judged on your work , but the only way that 's going to happen is if you successfully navigate the submission process . Think of the submission process as the first step to publication , because that 's exactly what it is . Its time consuming and a chore to make sure everything is perfect , but that 's what the gatekeepers want to see . You wo n't get past them with a half-assed effort . You 're being judged from the moment your envelope crosses their desk or the email shows up in their inbox . Be perfect . <p> This is something to keep in mind and look through before submitting a book . Avoiding common mistakes can be the difference between terrible writing and good writing , You need to take pride in your writing and avoid making simple mistakes . <p> Great information for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important . We need to give attention to all the small details as well . If you want a book to be accepted , you cant afford to make these types of mistakes . 
@@12747307 @1347307/ <h> If You Want to Be a Writer : Stephen King <p> What do you have to do if you want to be a writer ? Stephen King answers with a simple formula : read and write a lot . He has no patience for those people who say they want to be writers but also complain they do n't  have enough time to read . Voracious reading is a must if you want to be a good writer . <p> Then if you read enough , a really magic moment will always occur to those who want to become a writer . At some point , you 'll be reading a book , you 'll put it down , and you 'll say to yourself , " This really sucks . I can do better than this . And this guy got published . " <p> See for yourself and enjoy : <p> Here are ten additional writing tips from Stephen King <h> Write a Great Opening Line <p> The very first sentence your story begins with should intrigue your reader . Stephen King says it should make your reader think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't agree more . Ive read books that you have to persevere through before they really grab your interest , but the best ones have been page-turners from that opening paragraph . <h> Write for Yourself First , Then Think About Your Audience <p> What would you love to read ? If you can write something that would please you , then your story will attract people with similar tastes , and even those with different tastes who would like to experience something different . By writing something youd love , you 're more genuine and more engaged , and that appeals to the reader far more than something written without passion . <h> Do n't  Obsess About Perfect Grammar <p> Tell the story first , then redraft it , polishing up the grammar as you go . If you 're going to sit there pondering the " right " way to say something before the idea is fully formed , you may end up saying nothing at all . <h> Be Unafraid <p> Stephen is convinced that timidity is the writers greatest enemy . Do n't  worry about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something different from the norm . Get out there and tell your story fearlessly . <h> Never Stop Reading <p> As mentioned at the top of this article , he believes if you do n't  read , you ca n't be a writer . The more you read , the more you become inspired . You wont copy other authors . Instead , you 'll use your own voice . Stephen does n't  mince his words . According to him , those who do n't  have time to read , do n't  have time to write either . <h> Quit Watching TV <p> Stephen maintains that the TV is a writers greatest enemy . Although its pretty obvious that having the TV on while you 're actually writing is a bad idea , he says it saps your powers even if you watch TV at other times . Perhaps its because watching TV is a passive activity that leads little to the imagination . What do you think ? <h> Three Months Should Be Enough Time to Produce a Decent Book <p> Although some authors sweat over their novels for years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to get a book written . What he s saying is , " Do n't  overthink this or it is n't going to happen . " <h> Shut Out Distractions <p> Do n't  answer your phone when you are writing . Do n't  have your social media notifications on . Ask your family to leave you alone except if a matter of life or death were to arise . Concentrate on what you are doing to the exclusion of everything else . Create yourself a quiet writing space . Even the radio playing in the background will distract you from your work . <h> Write as You <p> No matter how much you admire the style of other writers , trying to use their style is a recipe for disaster . Develop your own style and be unique . Copy someone else , and be nothing but a shadowy imitation of something that is truly good . <h> Take a Rest and Reread <p> Stephen says that a six-week rest followed by a reread of your book will prove enlightening . Distance yourself from your work , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place naturally . <p> Learning from other peoples experience is hard to do , but when someone as successful as King offers you the benefit of his knowledge , ignoring it is just plain silly . It makes sense to take Stephen Kings writing advice to heart . <h> 6 comments <p> I admire Stephen King so much . His advice helped me get my first novel written and is currently helping me get the second one done as well . He gives such down to earth and basic writing advice without any of the unnecessary crap you often here . Just write and read every chance you get . It really is that simple . <p> I think the " quit watching TV " is a huge one just for the amount of time it frees up to write . I always hear about people who say they do n't  have time to write , but they have a list of TV shows they watch every night . If writing is n't a higher priority than a TV show , then you really do n't  want to be a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just insane . I have writer friends still on their first draft 4 years later . I guess if you want to churn out crap you can do it in three months , but any decent book needs to take more time than that . <p> Three months fora rough draft is plenty of time if you are serious about writing a book . People do it in a single month for National Novel Writing Month each November . its all a matter if you are serious about it or not . <p> Actually , it depends on how much time the writer has . If they have work or school , the time it takes to write the book will lengthen . Some writers have written their books just on weekends which can very rarely be done in the months . But to mention people write at different places . Every writer , book , and situation is different . 
@@12747308 @1347308/ <h> 46 Ways to Promote Your Writing <p> Whether your write books , articles , or keep a blog , if you want to make money you have to promote your work . Even if you are traditionally published , you 'll likely have to handle at least some of your own promotion . Publishers are cutting marketing departments and budgets and placing more responsibility on the authors themselves . ( Unless you 're hugely famous or they think your book will be a huge success , in which case they will do much more for you and you can stop reading now and go take a nap . ) <p> For everyone else , get ready to learn how to market . Just like needing to find time to write , you 're going to need to find time to market . Before you do anything else , though , you need to figure out who your ideal reader is and how you will reach them . It does n't  help your cause if you 're promoting in all the wrong places . You have to use the media that your readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your readers go . So , if your ideal reader is a forty year-old religious mother , being a guest blogger on " Bikers , Women , and Drugs " ( I made that up so if it really exists , sorry ) is n't likely to gain you the sort of exposure you need . <p> Take some time and figure out who is most likely to read your work , what they want , and how you can reach them . Then figure out what on this list will help you make those ideal readers aware of your work . <h> Your blog/website <p> Most writers need a website these days . You can post excerpts , let people know where you 'll be appearing , provide contact information , and sell books . A blog is a bonus . You can use it to keep readers updated on your work , share advice , or write about events in your field of expertise . <h> Speak <p> Non-fiction writers can speak about their topics at conferences , schools , and other gatherings . You can also speak about writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing conferences . When you speak , have copies of your work for sale , or at least have a handout ready listing your work and where to buy it . <h> Bookstore appearances <p> You may not be famous enough to warrant a cross-country book tour , but maybe you can appear at some local stores and sign books or do a reading . <h> Social media <p> There are so many social media sites these days that you could make a career out of doing nothing but keeping them all updated . So do n't  try to do them all . Pick two or three that you like the most ( and which your readers use ) and stick with them . Dedicate a set amount of time each week to updating them so you do n't  get caught spending more time social networking than writing . <h> Message boards <p> Find message boards that relate to your work and post helpful responses to questions . Put information about your work in your signature . Never spam a board with random links to your books , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to your website and/or social networking page . You can also put information about your latest book in your email signature . <h> Teach <p> If you 're an expert on something , see if you can teach somewhere . Community college classes , seminars , and business training sessions are all options . You can also teach your writing form or genre to writers groups or extension classes . <h> Go to conferences/workshops <p> Plenty of glad-handing and business card swapping goes on at writing conferences . You can also go to business conferences and conferences related to your field of expertise . Hand out your business card and have some books in your trunk that you can sell if you generate any interest . <h> Publish <p> If you 've written a book , try getting some articles published , as well . You can publish in magazines , newspapers , newsletters , or on other websites . Your credit at the end of the article will read something like , " Jane Doe is the author of Title X and resides in Michigan with her three cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your book ( and your cats ) . <h> Appear at related events <p> Diana Gabaldon writes the hugely successful " Outlander " series , which begins in the Scottish Highlands during the Jacobite rebellion . She frequently appears at events such as Highland games and related fairs and festivals . Successful sci-fi and fantasy writers often go to Comic-Con . If your book or work has a theme , see if there are events that are compatible at which you can appear . You may have to start small with local events rather than shooting for Comic-Con right off the bat . Figure out where your readers go and go there . <h> Leverage your biography <p> If there 's something in your life that has affected your work ( perhaps you are a cancer survivor writing about cancer treatments , or you 've suffered the traumatic loss of a spouse and you write about surviving grief ) , find a way to connect the two for your readers . Perhaps you appear at or contribute to charitable events related to your work . Perhaps you speak to high school kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal connection with your readers and the cause that inspires you . <h> Schedule a virtual book tour <p> Many authors now tour virtually rather than flying around the country . Its cheaper and less tiring . You can appear via Skype or online chat . Bloggers may take questions in advance and then post your answers at a later date . <h> Give your book away for free <p> With the rise of ebooks , its now possible to give your book away for free or at a greatly reduced price for a limited time . This can get your book in the hands of people who will leave positive reviews and spread word of mouth . <h> If your book is free , make sure everyone knows it <p> There are plenty of sites on the Internet that promote free ebooks . In most cases , you do n't  have to pay to be listed . <h> Get reviewed <p> Get your book into the hands of reviewers . This may mean giving away copies to bloggers , sending it to media outlets , or asking fellow authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book trailer <p> Many authors now create book trailers , similar to movie trailers , that show the highlights of the book . If you go this route , make sure its professionally done . A bad book trailer can be laughable and unless you 're writing humor , this is n't what you 're going for . <h> Put together a soundtrack for your book <p> Is there music that inspired you while you wrote ? Do the characters listen to certain music ? Create a playlist and post it on your website . ( Never post the actual songs for download . Include links to legitimate retailers where readers can buy the songs . ) Readers like to listen to the music that goes with the book . <h> Get other authors to comment on your work <p> No , you might not get Stephen King to offer a blurb for your book , but you may be able to find other authors who are willing to offer comments for your book jacket or website . Be sure to return the favor if you can . <h> Press release <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're publishing your first book . But a local media outlet just might , particularly if your story or biography has some relevance to the local community . Create a solid press release and then get it out to media outlets that will find your story interesting and relevant to their readers . <h> Guest post on blogs <p> Find the blogs that your readers frequent and ask if you can write a guest post about the topic of interest . You wo n't write about your own work , but your writing credit will read , " Jane Doe , author of XYZ . " <h> Invest in good cover art <p> Its true that books are often judged on their covers . An easy to read cover with good artwork and pleasing graphic design sells better than one that looks cheap or like it was put together by an eighth-grader . Good cover art can be re-sized to fit and look good on everything from business cards to websites . Unless you are gifted in this area , do n't  design your own cover . And do n't  use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from images and fonts to put together your own cover . Too many self-published books show up with the same images on the covers and its confusing to readers . <h> Connect with readers <p> List your contact information on your website and in the back of your book . If readers want to ask questions , complain or comment , or schedule you for a speaking engagement , make it easy for them to do so . <h> Make it easy to find your previous work <p> If this is n't your first book , make sure to include links or information about your previous books within the current book . You can also provide sample chapters from an earlier ( or forthcoming ) book to get readers interested in reading more . <h> Use book clubs <p> Submit your work to book clubs to see if theyll feature it as their selection . You do n't  have to aim for Oprah . There are plenty of local and online book clubs that might be interested . Include a discussion guide at the end of your book or as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always have copies available <p> Keep copies of your book in your car so that you can give or sell one to anyone who expresses interest . If yours is an ebook , have a business card on hand with links to your website or whatever websites are selling the book . I 've also known authors to keep USB thumb drives on hand with the book preloaded to give away . You never know when you 're going to get interest , so make sure you 're ready to capitalize on it . <h> Host a contest <p> You can not only give your book(s) away , but you can also include something else like a gift card or something related to the topic of your book . People love freebies and the chance to win something . The contest can also serve to build your email list so that you can send out newsletters or announce future releases . <h> Give away extras <p> If people buy your book by a certain date or from a certain website , or if they can provide proof of purchase , you can include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or chapters from the next book in the series . Think of it like including bonus features found on the enhanced edition of a DVD . <h> Cross-promote with other writers <p> Find other writers in your genre or field . Feature their blog posts on your website , link to their materials , and request that they do the same for you . <h> Leverage a collaboration <p> If your work is part of an anthology or was the result of a collaboration ( either amongst authors or illustrators ) , you should all be promoting each other as much as possible . <h> Market the total package <p> If you 've got multiple books , consider selling them as a bundle . If you write non-fiction and you have course materials , video , or audio lectures that support your content , consider bundling some or all of it together . Sell your bundle at a lower price than readers could buy the items individually and youll create a sense of value . Readers like to pass on word of the great deal they received . <h> Donate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clubs , shelters , or other organizations that might not be able or willing to purchase your work for themselves . <h> Create a Pinterest board for your book <p> Pin images and links that inspired your work or relate to it in some way . Maybe pin a picture of the location you used for your novel , or pictures of the clothes your characters wear . Some readers like to keep the details in their heads , but others like to see what the author saw while writing the book . <h> Appear in your alumni newsletter <p> Make sure your alumni association knows that you 're publishing a book and have them add you to the newsletter . Admit it : You always read the , " Where are they now ? " section and roll your eyes at the bragging that goes on in there . You might as well get in on the bragging , too . <h> Host a podcast <p> You can post podcasts on your website . Talk about your latest work , your writing process , works coming out by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest your readers . Keep it informative , speak clearly , and do n't  go on for hours . <h> Business cards <p> Some people say they 're obsolete in the digital world , but business cards are still incredibly useful . They can be easily handed out at conferences , appearances , and workshops . They can be included with press releases and marketing kits . Make them easy to read and include all relevant contact information . <h> Comment on other blogs <p> Take the time to post constructive comments on other blogs and make sure to include a link back to your website or a mention of your book . But do n't  comment just to make the link . " Cool post , dude ! " is n't effectively promoting your work . Make sure you have something useful to add to the conversation . <h> Be generous with your thanks <p> If someone helps you , be it a bookstore owner , blogger , or member of the media , be sure to say thank you . Send a personalized card or a thank you letter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend the work of someone who was polite and thoughtful than someone who was rude and ungrateful . <h> Create some merchandise <p> It does n't  have to be expensive stuff , but bookmarks , pencils , notepads , and other promotional items are nice to give away at appearances . If you have more funds , you can create more expensive items which are relevant to your book and something that your readers will find useful or fun . These can be the basis of contests and giveaways , and you can include them with book purchases or sell them in their own right . <h> Try consigning your book <p> If a bookstore wont buy your book , see if you can consign it with them . If it sells , they split the profits with you . If not , you take the books back and the store is out nothing . This can work with non-traditional outlets , as well . For example , if your book has a tie to a tourist location , see if you can place your book in gift shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and work colleagues <p> See if your family and friends would be willing to talk about your work with others they know , or if they might post it on their social networking profiles . You do n't  want to make a big deal out of this or force anyone into doing something they do n't  want to do , but a quick , " My sister just publisher her latest book ! " with a link to Amazon can reach people you might not reach otherwise . <h> Create a YouTube channel <p> You can post your book trailer , instruction videos ( if applicable ) and videos of your appearances and interviews . You can also put together slide shows , reviews of other books , and other videos as appropriate to your readers interests . <h> Throw a launch party <p> See if your local bookstore will let you host a launch party for your book . You can do a reading , speak on your topic , have a contest or raffle , provide refreshments , or play games , if appropriate . <h> Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many allow entry of previously published works . If you win or place , your work will likely be featured on the contest website and may be included in an anthology with other winners . <h> Approach organizations and businesses <p> If your book has a tie with an organization or business , see if you can interest them in buying some copies . Perhaps an animal rescue organization would like to sell or give away your book about how to foster dogs to their clients . Or maybe a large business wants your book on how to create dynamic sales presentations . <h> Blab <p> You do n't  want to be annoying , but never miss a chance to talk about your book . If someone asks , " What do you do ? " at a party , talk about your book . If you 're waiting to mail books at the post office and someone asks , " That looks heavy , what are you mailing ? " do n't  hesitate to tell them . If you wo n't toot your own horn , who will ? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice is simple . You want to promote your work , but you do n't  want to anger your readers , bookstore owners , or blog hosts . Its fine to ask for a chance to appear or contribute , but if the answer is no , do n't  whine or pester . If people are kind enough to subscribe to your email list or provide their emails in your blog comments , do n't  abuse it by sending them emails every day . Only send email when you have something new and relevant , not just begging emails . And provide a clear option for them to opt-out . And if someone says they 're not comfortable promoting your work ( its not their thing or they just do n't  like it ) , do n't  force or guilt them into it . You want to promote your work , not make everyone sick of you . <p> Do n't  try to do everything . There will always be something else you can do , or someone else who is doing more than you to promote their work . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is only so much you can do so do it well , be satisfied with it , and let it go . You could make marketing into your whole career , but you do n't  want to do that . Your main job is to write and you cant do that if you never stop promoting . Producing more work is the best way to promote your older work . <h> 7 comments <p> Well done This is ( as usual ) an outstanding post , and I was really stoked to find some ideas on here that were different yet pragmatic and atten-grabbing without looking like you 're a ridiculous eccentric using gimmicky shameless self-promotion . And I love that many of these can be extrapolated for creative projects other than a book . Thanks again , Jennifer . I love this blog . <p> Promoting my work is the most difficult part of being a writer for me . Its not writing the book , editing the book or anything that typically is considered difficult . Promotion is what gets me because I 'm an introvert at heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to promote that do n't  mean I have to be an extrovert in the process . <p> As a published writer , the one thing that they never tell you when you start off is the amount of promotion that you need to do . Writing is only half the battle . Its probably even less than half the battle . If you want to be a successful writer , you need to be a successful promoter . If you do n't  want to promote your writing , you 're going to have a hard time becoming a successful writer . <p> This is so true . Once your book is finished , that 's where the real work begins . There are so many aspects that going into being a successful writer that have nothing to do with sitting down in front of a computer and cranking out words . This is something that many aspiring writers do n't  understand . <p> Do n't  forget good old word of mouth . If you write things that people want to share with others , they will pass it on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books that they have read and it can be a great way to promote your writing . <p> Word of mouth works well if you are an extrovert and have a lot of acquaintances to get the ball rolling . if you tend to keep to yourself and are n't  that outgoing , its more difficult to take advantage of this way to promote your writing . Still , you should promote it as many different ways as you can to find what 's the most successful way for you . 
@@12747309 @1347309/ <h> 25 Ways to Improve Your Writing Vocabulary <p> A great vocabulary is just one essential tool in a writers toolbox , along with punctuation , grammar , and many others . Vocabulary can make your writing more powerful and more effective and help you say exactly what you mean . This indispensable tool will help you choose the best word for every job and avoid vague words that do not give your readers a good sense of your meaning . <p> Building your vocabulary is one of the easiest ways to improve the power of your writing and make any writing task that much easier , as you will have several synonyms in your repertoire to pull from every time . Developing your vocabulary need not be difficult or painful . Here are 25 ways you can improve your writing vocabulary every day . <h> Use New Words <p> Use a word immediately after you learn it . Try to make a game out of using a new word as soon as you learn it . Every day , try to slip in a new word into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to a friend . Do this as often as possible , and repeat the word to yourself . <h> Read Every Day <p> Once you 're out of school , word drills and assigned reading become things of the past . While these were tools for building your vocabulary repertoire while you were young , it does n't  mean you should abandon reading . Try to read a well-written and edited essay , magazine article , book or news article every day . Nonfiction and technical books will quickly teach you new ways to think and speak with words you may be unfamiliar with , but any type of reading will help you along . <h> Learn Roots <p> Learn the roots of words . Most words in the English language are built from a common root , prefix , and suffix , usually with an origin in the Greek or Latin language . Once you learn a root , you 'll begin to understand more words that use the same root . For example , -duc- ( Latin root word ) means to lead or to make , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thesaurus <p> Keep a thesaurus handy . As you write , keep a thesaurus handy and use it when you find yourself using a word too often , or using a word that you know does n't  quite convey the right meaning . This will help you better express yourself , and you 'll also learn a new word in the process . <h> Develop Practical Vocabulary <p> This means you should start by learning words that express what 's important to you for the task at hand . A good example of this is learning trade language or words you use often in a hobby or vocation . Rather than immediately turning to cliches or jargon that 's tossed around , look for clearer words to express to peers what you 're writing about . <h> Learn New Words Every Day <p> To improve your vocabulary quickly , make an effort to learn at least one new word every single day . There are plenty of ways to do this , such as a Word of the Day calendar or email list , or simply picking a word from a thesaurus or dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often do you come across words that are unfamiliar as you read ? Do n't  just gloss over them ; take the time to look them up , and if you do n't  have the time right then , write them down and look them up later . <h> Keep a Journal <p> Journaling wont just help you develop your writing style , it will also help you improve your vocabulary . Try to use new or interesting words you 've learned recently into a journal entry for the day or the week . <h> Identify Empty Words <p> You 're probably familiar with empty words in your speech ( such as " uh " or " um " ) , but your writing probably has empty words as well . Look for these empty words in your writing that do not offer any substance to your reader and replace them with something more appropriate . The same principle applies to phrases and sentences , so make sure that you have n't used six or seven phrases to say something that could be better communicated in one sentence filled with carefully-chosen words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the same sort of things day in and day out , you may not be exposing yourself to a wide enough range of vocabulary . Diversify the topics you read to include natural science , Shakespeare , contemporary literature , politics , history , philosophy or any other topics you think you may enjoy . <h> Do Word Puzzles <p> Word puzzles in the newspaper or a magazine are n't  just a fun way to fill time , they 're also perfect for boosting your working vocabulary . Crossword puzzles are a challenge that get your brain working hard to search your memory for words you do know but do n't  use , and this can help you move words from your memory banks into your working set of vocabulary which- will come across in your writing . <h> Try Word Board Games <p> There are plenty of word games on the market designed to improve vocabulary and language skills without being a bore . Some of these games you may have played as a child , so its time to break them out again and get to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also use some help or someone with a great vocabulary you think will challenge you invite them over for a game night . <h> Practice New Words in Divergent Ways <p> It takes between 10 and 20 repetitions to make a new word a part of your vocabulary . To help the word settle into your mind and memory , write it down ( both the definition and a sentence you make up using the word ) , use it in conversation , include it in an email or any other way you can think of . <h> Make up Associations <p> Start by saying the new word aloud , then relate it to a word you already know . A good example of this is gargantuan , which means " very large " or " gigantic . " Say a sequence aloud : small , medium , large , very large , gargantuan . Then list things you think are gargantuan . <h> Use Mnemonics <p> Mnemonic techniques are memory tricks you can use to remember new words . You may remember a word by sounding it out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as turning egregious ( extremely bad ) into " Do n't  let that smelly rotten egg reach us ! " <h> Visualize New Words <p> Research shows that visualization is a great way to remember new words and their meanings . A good example of this is the word stratovolcano , which is a high , pointed mountain with a violent explosion . One way to remember this meaning is the fact that the prefix " strato " sounds like " straight-oh , " which may make you think of a straight ruler or a " straight-o-volcano , " which describes the words definition . <h> Make Your Own Vocabulary Tests <p> Keep a list of the new words you learn each week and incorporate into writing and conversation . At the end of each week , make yourself a quiz using the words to cement them in your memory . <h> Make Synonym Word Lists <p> Do you find yourself turning to the same word again and again in your writing ? Grab a piece of paper and write it at the top . Next , brainstorm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty new words you can use instead . You can keep these lists in a vocabulary notebook and add to them whenever you learn a new synonym . <h> Take a Writing Course <p> There are plenty of online courses as well as in-person classes you can attend to boost your writing vocabulary and learn how to use new words correctly . Try to find a self-paced course that uses assignments and quizzes to hep you increase fluency and brush up on your writing skills . Some classes are aimed at essay writing or creative writing , so you can find a class that will help you improve the style you need the most help with . <h> Edit Your Own Writing <p> After you finish writing , be your own editor and go though the piece with a fine-toothed comb to identify overused and nondescript words with something more precise or colorful . Editing is an important process for spotting writing errors , but its also great for improving the tone , style , and clarity of your writing . It might help to read the sentences aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory for more descriptive words , or consult a thesaurus if you need to . <p> As you replace words , remember that using a large number of complex words wont necessarily clarify the meaning , and it may just make your writing more pompous . Ask yourself , " Do I know a better word to use instead ? " You may replace " use " with " acquire " or " obtain , " or " do " with " perform . " <h> Move Words from Comprehensive to Expressive Vocabulary <p> You actually have two types of vocabulary : one is a much larger set of words you understand , even if only vaguely , and the other is a smaller set of words you actually use to express yourself . Moving words from your comprehensive , but passive vocabulary , to your active , expressive vocabulary is easier than you think . To do this , you 'll need to know how to define , pronounce and spell the words . Say them out loud and use them at every opportunity to move them into your active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your writing could use some help ? If you 're struggling with your written vocabulary , try asking someone else for help . A second set of eyes can offer a great deal of insight and spot problems you may not notice yourself , including poor word choice . Do n't  be afraid to ask a friend , teacher , co-worker or someone online to review your writing for feedback on your vocabulary . <h> Carry a Dictionary and Thesaurus with You <p> How often do you find yourself with free time and nothing to do ? Carry a pocket thesaurus or dictionary with you and you 'll find time to beef up your vocabulary while you 're waiting for an appointment , commuting to work or waiting for a bus . Whenever you have a few minutes to spare , read a page or two and learn a new word to add to your writing . Its also a great idea to look up obscure words you do n't  quite grasp that come to you on the fly as you go about your day . You can also use the dictionary or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daily life . <h> Use College Preparation Tests <p> College prep tests that use SAT and ACT-type words are a great way to take your writing to the next level . This form of advanced study will challenge your mind and give you a new set of words to use that are practical and offer your writing the clarity it needs . You 'll also get the chance to brush up on the most important Latin and Greek roots and get a new set of words with activities to help move them into your active vocabulary set . <h> Play Games <p> There are tons of non-board games that will help you improve your writing vocabulary while you have fun . Try downloading fun word games onto your phone or computer so you can get some practice while you unwind after a busy day . Some games are designed to build vocabulary skills , but there are plenty of others that will help you practice spelling , phonics , and even typing skills . There are even some designed for college students to prepare for testing and vocabulary-rich exams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to start to build your vocabulary a bit at a time . If you think about it , there are opportunities all around you to develop this important skill , so spend time every day reading and listening to take in new words and then develop a system to incorporate these new words in your writing and speech . Before long , you 'll find your vocabulary has grown to a new level and your writing has gained the clarity you need with an ease you did n't  think possible . <p> Author Bio : Jovell Alingod is a Project Manager for eReflect maker of Ultimate Vocabulary , a software for vocabulary improvement with tens of thousands of happy customers in over 110 countries . <p> Any type the word challenge to increase vocabulary is a great way to do this . I personally like to find five new words in the dictionary each day that I did n't  know the meaning to before them . I do n't  always remember them all , but I do remember some and this helps me build my vocabulary . <p> Knowing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what a word means . Its like all the students who study English and know the definition of the words , but cant speak English . its the same thing here . <p> Linguistically there are two techniques for improving your lexical strength ( vocabulary ) : <p> Active learning and Passive learning <p> 1 . Passive learning : New words are acquired subconsciously , while doing some daily life stuff , like reading a newspaper . <p> Vocabulary is an abstract skill due to reasons like reading habits , family background , schooling , culture etc . The conventional methods are very generic and are made of masses . They do not allow personalised learning to an individual 's current vocabulary . <p> 2 . Active learning : Active learning methodology has become a preferred way to change the traditional teacher oriented classroom into the newer student oriented approach to learning . In active learning , acquisition of new words is done with conscious and great efforts . <p> Usually active vocabulary building is quite rigorous and boring due to its monotonous nature . <p> Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , but it makes a lot of sense . Active learning has always been tedious for me , but I really enjoy reading books , and this has helped improve my vocabulary greatly compared to my classmates . While I know I should spend more time actively learning new words , I feel a lot better knowing Im subconsciously learning new ones everytime I pick up a book . <p> Reading is good " Passive " way of improving vocabulary , but when you are resorting to making lists , that is " Active " method . Problem with active method of learning words is that it is cumbersome and boring , and you doing retain and unless you use it in writing sentences to apply the word , very little chance is that you increase your lexical size . <p> I think its important to do both passive and active vocabulary learning . Its true that you are going to have to figure out a way to make active learning interesting so that you can continue to do it long term , but there are ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at my new word for the day calendar in trying to figure out how I will use that new word sometime during the day . If you can find an easy way to incorporate active learning into your daily life , it can be fun . <p> Ive been trying to find good ways to improve the writing vocabulary of my students . Techniques to improve passive vocabulary are quite well established SRS , etc . However , the jury is still out on the best strategies to improve active/writing vocabulary . <p> Have you found any to be effective since you left this comment ? I 'm looking for some good ways to improve my vocabulary and if you found some good ones , that might save me a lot of time experimenting until I found a good method . Anyone else who has had success improving their vocab is also welcome to chime in . I would love to get some good methods going . <p> This is so important to good writing . If you are n't  improving your vocabulary on a daily basis then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions on how to keep those new words coming ! <p> This is something that many writers neglect to their own detriment . You should always be trying to improve your writing and these are some good ideas on how you can improve your vocabulary . Too many writers forget about this , and it shows in their word choices . Do n't  forget to spend time improving your craft ! ! <p> I agree with this . Its important to always be trying to improve whatever craft you have chosen to pursue . If your craft has something to do with words for speaking , improving your vocabulary is something that you should spend time doing . But this is n't limited to just vocabulary . You should be trying to improve other areas of your craft as well . <p> I try to learn at least one new word every day to improve my vocabulary . I like to read a lot , and I can usually find a word that I 'm not familiar with while reading . I will look up this word so that I understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next week . If I do n't  find the word while reading , then I 'll just randomly open up my dictionary to find a word that I was n't familiar with before . <p> I think this is a great habit to get into for anyone who wants to improve their vocabulary . If you do this for a while , you begin to love learning new words , and when you love doing something like this , its easy to build your vocabulary each and every day . <p> I 'm curious if anyone actively tries to improve their vocabulary each day . If so , how do you do it ? I would like to learn tips and tricks on how to improve my vocabulary each day . I look forward to seeing your comments on how I can do this . <p> I think its different for everybody . What will work for one person , wo n't work for the next . Chances are you 'll need to experiment quite a bit with a variety of the different suggestions above in the article to find which works best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different than my friend does . She does it by rote learning using flashcards . That would drive me absolutely crazy . I like to learn new vocabulary in a more natural way . But each of those ways works for each of us . <p> This is a pretty extensive list of ways one can improve their vocabulary . I find the best way to increase my vocabulary is to make the conscious effort to use words that I would not normally use in conversation . It takes some work to do this , but a lot of people say I have the best vocabulary of any person that they know . When you begin to learn a lot of new words , you become more articulate and are able to express yourself in ways you might not have been able to do before . I encourage everyone to give it a try . <p> Having a big vocabulary is n't always good , especially if you use it to try and show off like my friend . What 's the use of using words that most people wont understand just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to use words everyone understands so they actually know what you 're trying to say . Do n't  act like a pompous jackass . <p> That 's not having a large vocabulary that 's simply being an ass . being able to come up with the specifically correct word for a certain situation is a wonderful thing to be able to do . Its not for trying to show off , but just to be able to express yourself accurately . <p> The thing that people forget is that it takes a bit of work to improve your vocabulary . Its better to find ways that are enjoyable like reading books or a " word a day " email than trying to study them which can be boring . If you make it a game , it will be a lot more fun . <p> I agree that its important to find a way to enjoy learning new vocabulary rather than trying to learn it from the list . This is why he did vocabulary in school . All they would do is give you a list of words that you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make learning new words more enjoyable than just memorizing lists ? It seems like it would be a simple thing to do and then students would enjoy English a lot more . <p> I not only became better to write and pass examinations at the university but also to improve my colloquial English . In fact , many people do not know even their own language . I 'm writing a dissertation and just now I realized that I needed to increase my vocabulary . Without it , a person can not consider himself competent . To write a thesis is important not only choose an interesting topic , but also competently and clearly put down it on paper . Without it your ideas , your thoughts will not be able to understand people and professor will not be able to evaluate your work . Thesis that 's what I need , what I have to do for my future . And so I do not regret my time and effort to find more information about thesis writing . I do not cease to learn and improve my skills for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you have a good vocabulary or not ? Is there a standard number of words you need to know for others to identify you as having a good vocabulary ? I think if there was a number of words everyone knows they needed to know , more people would try to reach that goal . As it is now , its difficult to know if I have an adequate vocabulary or not . <p> Ive been working on improving my vocabulary for the last two months . I found that it was difficult to begin , but once I started , it became much easier . I try to do most of my vocabulary improvement through a lot of reading , but I do make an effort to look up words that I 'm not familiar with while Im reading instead of just passing them over or trying to guess their meaning . <p> I also try to use new words each day . For me at least , if I use the word I 'm able to retain it much better . I would say over this last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five words a day and I 've added well over 100 new words to my vocabulary . <p> Does anyone visualize words to help them improve vocabulary ? I started doing this a few months ago and its help me improve my vocab quite a bit . I 'm a visual person , though , so that may be something that applies to me more than others . If you happen to be a visual person , try visualizing new words and you may be amazed at how many you are able to learn over a short period of time . <p> This is something that everyone should be striving to do no matter their age . I think its important to teach kids at a young age how interesting words are so they can find value and love within them . Being curious about words and where they came from ( and finding the perfect word for what you want to say ) is a type of curiosity wed all be better having . <p> Knowing a large number of words will make you much more articulate in your conversations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways in life . Those hours of learning will pay off . You need to figure out a fun and entertaining way to learn those words . <p> Before you work on new vocabulary , you should make sure you already understand the basics . There is nothing worse than someone using big words while the small words are being incorrectly used . A sure sign the person thinks big words are important , but has no idea how to use words in general . 
@@12747310 @1347310/ <h> 20 Helpful and Fun Products for Writers <p> Most writers do n't  need a whole lot to practice their trade . Once you have the basics like a computer , software , paper , and pens/pencils , ( and oh , yes , space in which to write ) , those are the only tools you really need to be successful . That being said , there are many more products writers may find both helpful and fun . If you 're looking for a gift idea , or just looking for something that may help you in your writing life , take a look at the following list . <h> A Writer Tshirt <p> Giving a writer a fun writer Tshirt that can be proudly worn is a great way to show your support his or hers writing . It gives them the opportunity to show the world what they do with a bit of humor . If you 're not sure what to give as a gift to a writer , this is a great default . <h> A journal ( maybe more than one ) <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , or where you can work through problems that are impacting your work . They can also be places to keep ideas and experiment with forms like poetry or lyric writing . You can have one journal for everything , or get a few and dedicate them to different types of writing . <h> Whiteboard ( maybe more than one ) <p> I tend to be forgetful and I tend to come up with good ideas when a pen and paper or my laptop are n't  available . Bad combination . To help , I got a couple of small whiteboards and put one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen . Now when I get a great idea in the shower or while making dinner , I can jot it down on the board . These are more water and damage resistant than electronics or paper and are great for messy environments . <h> Dictionary <p> Yes , I know the computer has a dictionary function , but many are not as robust as a large , old fashioned , print dictionary . Plus , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up random words in the dictionary . <h> Thesaurus <p> See Dictionary , above . The same idea applies because most computer thesauri are not as comprehensive as their print counterparts . <h> Cork board <p> Some writers like to " storyboard " by writing or drawing elements and scenes from their books on index cards and then arranging them to see how they fit together . You can move the cards around if you think of a better arrangement . Its a more visual form of outlining . A cork board makes this easier than laying everything out on the floor , only to have to pick it up to vacuum , or having it blow around when people walk past . <h> Spiral bound notebooks <p> During the back to school shopping season , you can find packs of four or five notebooks for less than $1 . Theyre great for jotting down ideas , research notes , and character descriptions . Keep one by your bed for those ideas that come to you late at night . Yes , you can use your computer or cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing some things out longhand clarifies my thoughts more than banging away at a keyboard . <h> Calendar <p> Whether you go digital or get a wall calendar or weekly planner , a calendar is a must to keep track of deadlines and to-dos , <h> Spreadsheet software <h> Financial software or ledger <p> If you do n't  want to use a spreadsheet to track your income and expenses , get some good financial software . At the very least , get a ledger and make sure you write everything down . Itll make tax time much easier . <h> Basic grammar/style guide <p> The Elements of Style , by Strunk and White remains the gold standard grammar and style guide . If you are a technical writer or business writer , you may find The Chicago Manual of Style useful , as well . There are also guides for academic writers and other specialties . <h> Apps <p> There are tons of apps that you might find useful , too many to list here . There are apps for note taking , calendars , word processing , script writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . Spend some time shopping the app store for your platform of choice to see what you might find useful . There are also plenty of games to help you waste time , so shop carefully . <h> File cabinet and files <p> No matter how digital you try to be you will always have paper to file . It keeps drifting in even when you actively try to avoid it . At the least you 'll probably need a file drawer in your desk or an accordion file . At worst , you 'll need a full blown file cabinet or some bankers boxes . <h> Amazon Prime membership <p> For $99 per year , you get free two day shipping on most things that Amazon sells . ( You also get free movie rentals and book loans , but those are just perks . The real value is the shipping . ) Its so nice to be able to order ink , toner , paper , envelopes , and other supplies ( plus not having to take time away from writing to go to the store ) and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder <p> There are apps for this , or you can buy a more old school recorder . Either way , these come in handy for recording interviews and making notes to yourself on the fly . <h> Lap desk <p> A lap desk is great to have on hand for those times when you want to write or do research on the bed or couch . It keeps your laptop from burning your legs and let 's you get into a variety of positions so you can work in comfort . <h> Amazon gift card <p> This comes in handy for buying those deeply discounted Kindle books , apps , and MP3s that Amazon sells . Having a gift card balance on your account eliminates the need to put bunches of those $1.99 or $0.99 charges on your credit card , which can get your card shut down for suspected fraud . If you have Prime , listed above , its also great for all those $5.00 shipments you can now order without paying for shipping . <h> Page flags <p> These are great for marking passages while researching or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes in library or borrowed books in which you can not make your own notes . <h> Personalized note cards <p> Yes , much of life is digital these days , but there is still something to be said for the power of a handwritten thank you note on a nice note card . Theyre great for sending to agents , editors , and others whove taken the time to help you . <h> A good coffee machine <p> If you 're a coffee drinker , you can save a fortune by making your own instead of hitting Starbucks every day . You might like a Keurig or similar single cup coffee maker that let 's you rotate through a variety of flavors ( tea and hot cocoa , as well ) every day . Or you might prefer a good espresso machine or a simple regular coffee maker . <h> Rorys Story Cubes <p> These are " dice " that you roll which act as story generators . They are available in the original set , plus two newer sets that add actions and voyages to the mix . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with others using the game rules that come with them . The cubes are also available as an app so you can roll on the go . <p> Not every product is ideal for every writer . Some prefer old-school solutions , some prefer high tech , and others like a mix . Think about how you work best and choose products the help , not hinder , you . <h> 26 comments <p> Kind of mixed feelings about Amazon recommendations . They destroy the physical stores , especially the book stores . Perhaps its an inevitable evolution , but Amazon then treats their employees like crap and strong-arm publishers who then start buying each other out to resist this . So now there are less publishers . <p> My guess is that in the near future , Amazon will begin to buy publishing houses . Before you think this is ridiculous , look at Netflix and how they now produce their own content . It makes sense that Amazon would do the same thing . <p> I have to say I was flabbergasted when I saw the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an appalling system , which now actually provides no value at all , since you have to pay almost twice as much as it used to be to cover the inclusion of the so-called free Prime Instant Video , whether you want it or not . And the prices of products available for Prime Free Shipping are invariably higher than those without , so you 're often paying the same amount whether you chose to use Prime or pay for next day delivery . At -79 per year here in the UK , I would be spending more for the Free Shipping than I actually spend on items from Amazon in the first place ! When they remove Prime Instant Video from the subscription I might consider it again , but until then I 'll just buy my books at Waterstones and WH Smith and my office supplies at Staples . <p> I think the thing writers need most are ideas . There are two " kinds " if you will : a ) you are absolutely free to choose your subject or b ) you have to write about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advantages and drawbacks . When trying to conjure up ideas " out of the blue " your mind may go blank but when you 're under pressure to deliver on a certain subject you might easily be held back by fear of under-performance . One of the ways , I find , to overcome this , and I find it rather intriguing , is : in situation a ) try and think what ( paid ) assignment you would rather have ( rather than to choose on your own ) . In situation b ) try and think of what you would like to write about INSTEAD of what you have been " ordered " to . Then try and find a way to meld this " free " choice with your assignment . Both ways tend to work they just take your brain out of a quandary and let it " breathe " . <p> Thank you for writing this . Ive been struggling with finding my place when writing and this was just what I needed to read . It has helped me see the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future thinking like this instead of " all writing is the same " Virtual hug for helping me understand my own writing a bit better ! <p> It 's always great to find out how to make writing a little bit more fun and exciting . Sometimes using new tools can help invigorate your writing so you are able to do it better . I 'm always looking for a small advantage to keep my writing fresh and interesting . <p> Coffee . A lot of coffee each and every day . I think this is a highly underestimated product that all writers need . And red wine . A nice glass of red wine in the evening ( or two ) can do wonders for your writing . Just be sure to reread what you wrote and edited the next morning . <p> Everyone should have a journal even those who are n't  writers . Its a great way to keep your thoughts in order and see how you have progressed over the years . Sure , all writers should have a journal , but I think everyone should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wish I had started even earlier . <p> I 'm a big journal fan as well . Its a place where I can just write without any pressure to produce something others would like to read . Just me and my thoughts which ultimately helps my overall writing . For those who do n't  already keep a journal , you should give it a try . I think you 'll like the results to your overall writing . <p> I think all writers need to find support . Its such a tough and grueling experience being a writer that you need to find those who will encourage you to continue to reach your writing dreams . There are a lot of negative people when it comes to writing , so finding those who will support you in good times and bad is a great resource to have . The Internet has made this a lot easier <p> On this line of thought , buying a writer a writers retreat is a great gift . There is nothing writers love more than a block of time to get away from everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are looking for good ideas for a gift for a writer , the best thing to do is ask the writer . They know exactly what they want most but they do n't  have . If its not appropriate to ask the writer directly , spend some time listening to them when they 're talking about their writing . Most of them will let you know in conversation what they wish they had that they do n't  currently have . Writers tend to be pretty easy to buy for if you just listen to them a bit . <p> This is the best advice in the comment section , Ask . Its far better to know what the writer wants than to try and guess what he or she might want . I 've never understood why people have such a difficult time asking writers what they need or want . Most have a long list they are more than willing to share . <p> I do n't  understand why people do n't  ask what I need/want and try to guess it . I 'm so much more appreciative when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need to make that happen . <p> Every writer is different and may want something that the next writer does n't  . The worst thing you can do is assume what they want . If you are n't  willing to ask , at least pay attention when they talk about their writing . Chances are they will indirectly tell you want they want/need . <p> The best gift to give a writer is peace and quiet so they can actually write . Take the kids out for the day so there is no noise in the house and they can work without interruptions . What I would give for a gift like that ! 
@@12747312 @1347312/ <h> What to Do If Youre a Victim of Plagiarism <p> You 're trawling the internet one day and you see one of your articles or blog posts posted on someone elses website . Your byline is missing and there 's no reference back to the website where the original work was posted . Or , you 're reading a book and you notice that one section seems familiar and then it dawns on you that its so familiar because you wrote it . Yet there 's no citation listing you as the author . Yeah , you 've been plagiarized . You might have a moment where this makes you secretly happy . In some ways , its a twisted validation of your work . Hey , my stuff was good enough to be worthy of stealing ! But then you get angry . " What right does this person have to use my hard work without compensation or credit ? " Answer : Absolutely none . <p> You can let it slide , but the plagiarist will likely just keep stealing . If not from you , from someone else . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior ( or at least make yourself a less attractive target ) . If you 've been victimized , here 's what you need to do to uphold your rights . <h> Document the plagiarism <p> This is especially important in cases of online plagiarism where the content in question can be easily removed when the plagiarist senses trouble brewing . Print the page in question ( keeping the headers intact ) , or do a screen capture of the work in question showing the URL . Keep a physical copy of the work of any books or magazines in which your work appears uncredited . <h> Figure out how much work was stolen <p> This may be time-consuming , but try entering paragraphs from several of your articles into search engines to see if you get any matches . Search through the site where you found the first offense to see if there are any others . Often a plagiarist does n't  stop with just one piece . If you find your work on multiple domains , do a WHOIS search to determine who owns those domains . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff on all of them thinking you wo n't connect the dots . <h> Figure out who you 're dealing with <p> Are you dealing with a company , a famous blog , or an individual ? If the piece in question has been posted on a large company website or a famous blog , you may have more recourse simply because the company is n't going to want to have their reputation sullied by accusations of plagiarism . The owners of the website will likely be responsive to your request for compensation and will probably go after the author . At the very least theyll remove the work in question . <p> If you 're dealing with an individual who simply lifted your stuff for their personal blog , you 're probably dealing with someone who does not have the money to pay out on any claims . And the person may be a jerk who tries to claim that you are actually the thief ( more on this below ) . The best you may hope for is an apology and the removal of your work . Youll be lucky to get any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work is posted on a large website or in a book/magazine , you need to contact the publisher , not the author . The author will do nothing to help you and may try to hinder you by reverse-claiming you as the plagiarist . Contact the publisher and demonstrate proof that your work has been stolen . If you 're dealing with an individual , you have no choice but to contact them directly . They may be apologetic , or they may want to fight . You have to decide how hard you 're willing to fight if it comes to that . In either case , send the contact person a cease and desist letter , along with an invoice ( if appropriate ) and details about what you expect them to do next ( remove the content , pay up , stop printing books , etc . ) . Send all correspondence by certified mail , if you can , since this will provide a record of your contact . <h> Figure out what you want <p> Is it enough that the offending content is simply removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will a link back to your original article suffice ? Do you want the publisher to immediately cease and desist printing books that contain your content ? Tell the contact person what remedy you want . If you want to be paid for your work , you can try submitting an invoice with your initial communication demanding your standard fee . Sometimes that 's enough to scare an individual into paying up or at least removing the content . <h> Be willing to negotiate <p> If the person ca n't afford to pay you , consider other remedies such as a public apology posted on their site . If the site gets relatively heavy traffic , you can ask that they post a link back to your original site in the apology or in the purloined content . That may bring in enough visitors to act as compensation for your work . <h> Go to the web host and/or search engines <p> If you 're not getting help any other way , report the offender to the company that hosts their website and/or request removal from search engines . Website hosting companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they may be willing to help you . <h> Lawyer up only as a last resort ( and only if its worth it ) <p> A lawyer is expensive and should only be invoked after everything else has failed . And only if they can do anything for you . If you 're fighting with an individual , the chances are good that you would pay more in legal fees than you could ever recover from the plagiarist . Even if you get them to agree to pay you for the work , that amount will likely pale in comparison to your legal costs . You might make a point , but you have to determine whether making that point is worth it financially to you . If you 're dealing with a company , however , a lawyer may be able to recover significant damages for you . Talk to a reputable attorney and see what they say . <h> Keep records <p> Keep records of any and all contact with the plagiarist or publishers . You 'll need it if you have to escalate your efforts beyond the first contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to go to court . <h> Contact your network <p> If you have a network of other writers that you know ( either online or in real life ) , alert them to the plagiarism . They may want to check to make sure that your plagiarist is n't stealing their stuff , too . If several of you are affected by the same plagiarist , you can band together as a group and you may get better results than if you each approach the thief individually . If you want to pursue legal action , splitting the legal fees can make such action a more appealing option than going it alone . <p> Plagiarism is serious business . Reputable companies and websites will be horrified to learn that they are posting stolen content and will likely do all they can to get it removed and punish the plagiarist . It can be harder to get any resolution from an individual , but it may still be worth it to simply let them know that you know what they 're doing . It may not stop their activities entirely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2 comments <p> This is sometimes a very hard matter to resolve as there is so much content online and so many writers that are willing to take what is n't theirs .

I know it is hard to always write original content , but it is necessary to respect the work of other writers out there . How would you feel if someone copied what had taken you a long time to write ? 
@@12747313 @1347313/ <h> Category : Paid to Write <p> Many freelance writers work or have worked for a content mill at some point . Many have regretted the experience . Content mills are websites devoted to posting tons of articles on almost every subject imaginable ( and some that are n't  , see number six , below ) . Quality standards vary and most pay very little for the work required . While some writers hope that content mills will help them break into freelancing or be a way to make some extra cash , both are unlikely . There are many good reasons to shun the mills . Here are some of the best : <h> Paltry pay <p> There are two issues with this . First , content mills pay pitiful rates , some as low as a penny per word . This means that a 700-word article would only net you $7.00 . The federal minimum wage is higher than that . To make just $20,000 a year you 'd have to write 2,857 articles . That 's nearly eight articles per day . Every day . No vacations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , that 's an eight-hour workday every single day of the year . And youd still only make $20K . There are much better ways to make money . <p> Second , the low pay of content mills contributes to a growing problem for writers : The desire of content providers to get quality work for low pay . When other content providers see the mills paying such paltry rates they figure , " Hey , why should we offer more ? The low pay model seems to be working for them . " It gets harder for writers to command the rates that they deserve when there are so many low paying markets out there having no trouble filling writing positions . Stick up for yourself and your worth and refuse to work for less than you legitimately deserve . <h> The mills stifle creativity and quality <p> Content mills are oriented toward one thing : Search Engine Optimization , or SEO . This means that your articles will be crammed with specific keywords that will try to bounce that article to the top of any search for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this well and still produce a high quality , creative article . Youll be churning out work that fits a very narrow set of requirements . There 's no room for your unique voice or any facts or issues that deviate from the narrow focus required by the mill . <h> You probably wont gain any respect <p> Some writers believe that the mills are a way to " break in " and gain writing credits that can be parlayed into higher paying gigs . This is rarely the case . Because these pieces are rarely your best work ( written quickly , skimpy on details , etc. ) , you may not even want to submit them as credits . And even if you do , most reputable , higher paying markets will not view them as quality credits . You may be able to get away with listing some content mill pieces in an otherwise robust portfolio of work , but as your sole credits those pieces will not gain you the respect you need to get ahead . <h> Hoop jumping <p> You 'll likely have to jump through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles have to go through an approval process before being accepted , there may be a probation period where you have to submit articles but you wo n't get paid , etc . ) . You may play their game and go through all of their processes and still not get paid or hired on as a contributor . You 're probably better off writing for publications that have much clearer acceptance and employment processes . <h> Frustrating guidelines <p> Many content mills have a lot of guidelines for their writers , and some are not clear or are ever changing . For example , they may place limits on the sources you can use for research to keep you from using competing publications . However , you may not be provided with a list of banned sources until your turn in an article that includes one . Then your article gets rejected . You probably wont work with one editor all the time , either , and each one may have a different set of expectations and standards . What is accepted by one may be denied by another , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another area where one segment of the site follows one set of rules while another follows something else . These formats may not be expressed clearly in the beginning leading to more rejected articles . Sometimes it can feel as if the mills are doing everything they can to make your job harder . <h> You may end up churning out ridiculous , nonsensical work <p> Content mills often come up with the title and then expect you to write the article to match . Since most of the sensible titles have been used , you get some strange titles that are largely just hot SEO keywords lumped together . They may make no sense at all and there may be no way to write an article that makes any sense . Writing about " Clay Aiken The Pokemon Earthquake " would be a stretch for even the most gifted writer . <h> You 're not building a network that you can draw upon later <p> When you 're writing for the mills , you 're not working with reputable professionals who can help you make contacts or navigate the publishing world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors that garner respect in the writing world . They wo n't make useful references or help you further your career . <h> You do n't  care , and it shows <p> Writing for a content mill is about one thing : Generating a lot of words quickly . It does n't  matter whether you care about the topic or not . It does n't  matter whether you know anything beyond the basics or not . All that matters is the words . As a result , the articles show no passion and no depth . They read like what they are : Something rushed together without a care about the subject . If you want to be known as a writer who writes compelling , accurate , engaging , and informative pieces , a content mill is not for you . <h> You 're not learning anything <p> There are no professional editors helping you polish your work and teaching you how to become a better , more engaging writer . They may check for basic grammar and spelling errors , but that 's it . You 're not learning how to research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information off a list of pre-approved sources . You 're not learning how to market your work because the site is doing that for you . You 're not learning any of the skills that a professional writer needs to succeed . All you 're learning to do is write to a specific formula that is useless in any field other than the content mills . <h> The ratio of time to money is way off <p> You 'll spend the better part of a day churning out an article that might pay you $5 . Even if you 're super fast at writing and researching , you 're still going to put in a lot of time for very little money . Time is the one resource you cant get back . Its generally better to spend your time working on things that will grow your " brand " as a writer and lead to better paying work . Work on your own website/blog that you can monetize , pitch articles to well-paying publications and sites , seek out corporate clients , work on that novel , or get that non-fiction book proposal together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks , but if you 're only going to earn pennies anyway , it might as well be in the service of something that you can build on and control rather than a content mill that is taking your labor and giving you nothing in return . <h> The mills are like quicksand <p> Its too easy to get sucked in . You start out just trying to bridge the gap so you can make rent this month or put aside a little fun money . Before you know it , though , you 're working day and night for the mills because you need the income . You think you 're making some sort of progress in your career , but all you 're really doing is wasting time that could be better spent putting together higher quality gigs . You cant get out because you need the money , but the mill is sucking up all of your time that you could use to look for better work . It becomes a vicious circle . <h> Opportunity rarely knocks <p> When you write for reliable , reputable publications and websites you 'll probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work and ask you to write for them , or ask if they can obtain the rights to publish your piece elsewhere . This does n't  happen with the mills . People may see your work , but they are n't  likely to care . <h> You have no protection or control <p> If the content mill folds , you 're out of work and you likely wont be paid for any outstanding work . They can terminate your account at any time and for any reason . They can refuse your article for any reason and not pay you . As a professional freelancer , you should have more protection than this . Most legitimate freelance projects come with contracts that cover what happens in the event your article is rejected or needs more work , the editors/owners change , etc . There is more protection for you than you 'll ever get with the mills . <p> The only reason to write for a content mill is if you really enjoy the process or you 're just killing time and want a little extra cash . That might make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance your career , however , the mills are largely a waste of your time . There are far better ways to make money , improve your writing , and build your writing " brand . " Spend your time wisely by seeking out legitimate clients and working with true industry professionals . The mills will simply take your time and give you little in return . <p> If it was published in newsprint , Scary Mommy would be one of those tabloids you find at the checkout stand in grocery stores .

Bird Talk magazine does accept humor ( " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about birds . <p> The mystery behind feather plucking ( vets say its a symptom of anxiety ) is just one of the feature stories in the latest issue of Bird Talk . Its a serious magazine for adults who are into parrots , canaries , finches , and doves . The editorial staff seeks unflinching yet compassionate depictions of caring , feeding , health , grooming , training and just about anything else related to pet birds . <p> They publish historical essays , human-interest pieces , photo essays and , yes , humor . About the only thing they do n't  want is fiction , or " stories in which a bird speaks as if it were a human . " The bird related medical advice comes mostly from veterinarians . <p> The pay is something to tweet about : $100 to $200 for features under a thousand words , and up to $400 for pieces that run 1,500 to 2,500 words . <p> Access Bird Talks writers guidelines from its Web site ; its detailed and specific . What tone should a writer take ? They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they advise . " Informal means a friendly tone with words our readers commonly use , no slang or profanity . " <p> And they want all knowledge you convey in your piece referenced from original sources . They want serious journalism . No poppycock . They like sidebars stuffed with information . <p> Study the magazine before you pitch . And maybe reread Strunk and Whites The Elements of Style while you 're at it . The writers guidelines say " extraneous words should ( sic ) removed " ( they left out the be ) . <p> But those are just the bare bones of the guidelines . <h> Pros <p> You pretty much have to be a pet bird lover or owner to write for Bird Talk . If you 're a vet working with birds , the door to writing for them is pretty much open . The pay is some serious feed , up to $400 for a feature story . <h> Cons <p> If you 've never been around pet birds , its going to take some long and serious research to get your writing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine . <p> If you are interested in writing for this publication , you can find more information about their requirements here .

They want " stories that scan the horizon for the next big issue . " And they need writers exploring that far-off landscape . " News of the World Environment " is its tagline . <p> It wants environmental news , investigative journalism , and commentary . To get a handle on exactly what they ar looking for in an article , take the time to read a few back issues before you pitch a story . <p> Twenty-five cents a word is what they pay for 1,200 " 1,500-word dispatches . Investigative features can run up to 3,000 words and earn as much as $1,000 for the writer . They suggest writing online reports which are published five days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It reports on delicately shaded studies of vulnerability through the people and communities who seek to make a difference . It wants to see empathy and humanism . If a place is worth conserving , its worth writing about . <p> The big stories must have characters , even though they may have less to do with the story than the significance they are producing . Keep asking yourself what is this piece really about . Its not a story about environmental work , its a story about people who are doing environmental work . <p> A recent feature in the print magazine explored the myriad ways tourism , and its mega-developments , have overrun Grand Canyon National Park . Another story explores unconventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste your time pitching the demise of clean water in your backyard spring . It needs to be something that would be applicable to anyone on the grand scheme of things , not just a small community of people .

Its world is larger than you . They pay well . The online edition offers quick hits for writers au courant with environmental news . <h> Cons <p> The print magazine is a quarterly publication . Long lead times and payment on this publication can mean six months between pitching a story and finally getting payment . For those who ca n't afford the wait to get payment , this is n't the publication for you . <p> You can find out more information on writing for this publication here . <p> " Exposing repression , reporting resistance , empowering dissent , " reads the tagline at Dissent News Wire , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real journalism , " 700 to 1,500 words in length , paying $100 to $250 , and maybe more if you dig deep . This can be a quality opportunity for the right writers looking to make money from their craft . <p> By " real journalism " you should assume you need to get it right , and your writing ca n't be boring . Its about shoveling the coal and adding all the glitter of the Web linking to more detail , videos and characters . When two inmates at Nebraskas Tecumseh state prison were found dead , Dissent News Wire was there . <p> They want you to pitch stories by giving them a nut graph , maybe 100 words in length . They like news about people taking action , about movements around the country that get stonewalled in their " ability to organize and dissent . " Remember Occupy Wall Street ? You bet Dissent News Wire was there . If you 've had boots on the ground as an activist and you have a story to tell , theyd like to hear from you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning we all have a right to dissent " without threat or intimidation . " Democracy is about speaking out and being heard , right ? The villains in their stories are most often local , state and federal authorities . <p> Think Ferguson . Cleveland . Those examples ought to get the juices flowing if you 're so inclined . Agencies that " suppress dissent " of " movements , organizations , groups or individuals " are the targets of their " real journalism . " Along with news stories , theyll take opinion pieces of analysis and commentary . Essays and interviews also are wanted . <p> Major themes they cover include government policies that shackle dissent , cloud transparency or lead to mass arrests at protests around the country . Document repression of citizens , laws that limit dissent , excessive surveillance , even historical stories of dissent , and you might hit a home run with them . <p> It should n't be too difficult to get the point of this publication . In short , they are looking for stories that paint a picture of the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other company or organization is getting in the way of people wanting to express their opinions , they want you to write about it . <h> Pros <p> Nothing beats writing for a cause you believe in . What 's that old writers line Let a person in a garret burn with enough intensity and they will set fire to the world . And the pay here is not bad ; you might even eat a meal in that garret . There was a time when journalism was more than a profession it was a public good vital to our democracy . You can be a part of that . <h> Cons <p> Real journalism is hard work . It takes time , often a lot more than an article you can research by yourself on the Internet . Youve got to go through the motions of journalism .

@@12747316 @1347316/ <h> Year : 2015 <p> Its almost that time again . Time to resolve to get your entire life under control , preferably by February first . Yes , its time for the dreaded New Years resolution . This year , in addition to trying to lose weight , quit smoking , save money , or give up some other addiction , why not resolve to improve a part ( or parts ) of your writing life ? You might find that fixing up your writing life leads to improvement in other areas as you gain confidence and success in your work . And even if it does n't  , youve still accomplished something significant . Here are some ideas to get you started . <h> Finish the Project <p> Whether you 're working on a book , short story , article , or poetry , finish whatever it is you 're working on . Its easy to get sidetracked or frustrated and jump from project to project , never finishing anything . But a finished work ( and by finished , I mean revised , edited , and as perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should be submitting for publication , which is resolution #2 . <h> Submit the Project <p> Just do n't  submit it until its finished . In the rush to feel like you 're making progress its tempting to send things out too soon . Resist this urge and wait until its as great as you can make it . You might get rejected , but you might also get accepted . Submitting the work is the only way to know for sure . <h> Try Something New <p> If you normally write novels , try a memoir . If you normally write short articles , try a novel or short story . Trying new forms of writing keeps the creative juices flowing and may introduce you to something you really enjoy . <h> Call Yourself a Writer <p> Do you write ? Then you 're a writer and you shouldnt be afraid to label yourself as such . Too many of us hem and haw when asked , " What do you do ? " Just own it . " I 'm a writer . " <h> Exercise <p> Yes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for writers . We tend to spend too much time sitting on our butts . ( Whether were working or mindlessly surfing the Internet and calling it " work , " the result is the same . Too much butt-sitting . ) In addition to just being good for you , exercise boosts creativity and gives your mind a chance to roam free for a while . Bonus points if you can go outside and get some fresh air and new scenery . <h> Make Writing a Priority <p> Find them time in your day to write . This may mean skipping other fun activities , or letting some chores or errands pile up for another day . Do whatever you have to do to make writing a priority in your life instead of something that you do in your spare time . <h> Read More <p> Good writers read a lot . Read fiction , non-fiction , poetry , memoir , or the back of cereal boxes . You 'll get ideas and improve your craft by studying those who do it better ( and worse ) than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal , resolve to be more consistent about writing in it . Or , start a different kind of journal . Maybe you 're keeping one that tracks your daily activities , but can you also add one dedicated to your creativity or travel ? Writing about something new can open you up to new ideas . If you do n't  keep a journal , start one . It gives you some writing practice and may let you see ideas and problems in ways you have n't before . <h> Learn at Least One New Thing <p> Take a class in something or make an effort to study on your own . It does n't  have to be writing related . The more things you know , the deeper your well of experience that you can draw upon when writing . And if you take a class , you might meet some interesting " characters " for your work . <h> Stop Beating Yourself Up <p> If you get rejected or things are n't  going as you hoped , do n't  get down on yourself . Calling yourself a failure or talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get published so why bother ) are counterproductive . It hurts you and is n't necessary . You do n't  have to be super positive all the time , but do n't  flog yourself to death . If you get rejected , try to say , " That one did n't  work out . Ill try again . " This is supposed to be fun and if all you 're doing is beating up on yourself , that 's not fun or healthy . <h> Back-Up Your Data <p> We all know we should do this , but a surprising number of people do not . Do you really want to try to rewrite your novel from scratch , or pay someone several hundred dollars to try and recover your data in the event of computer failure ? And remember : If you lose your laptop , recovery is n't an option . A backup drive or cloud service can be had for $100 or less and is well worth it for the peace of mind . <h> Get Organized <p> This is another one that many people attempt every New Year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing life . ( Many people give up on this one because organizing the whole house seems impossible , but since you 're only going to organize your writing space , you 're already ahead of the crowd . Do more if you want to , but at least get your writing area under control . ) Get a file cabinet , clean up your hard drive , get an in/out box , or use whatever other methods work for you . It does n't  have to be pretty or trendy , just functional . <h> Set a Realistic Overall Goal for the Year <p> Maybe your goal is to query twenty agents or get six new clients . Maybe you want to complete a novel and a short story , or to earn 5% more than you did last year . Pick one goal for the year and then spend the year tracking your progress . Just be realistic . You probably wont finish thirty novels this year , nor will you make 50% more than you did last year . Being realistic leads to success . Overblown goals lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the challenges of writing is showing up for work every day . There 's always so much else you could ( maybe should ) be doing . Train yourself to show up every day . Marking a calendar with an " X " or a sticker every day that you write is a good idea . After a few days of consistently showing up , you 'll have a nice string of marks that you wo n't want to break . When tempted to skip out on a day , the thought of breaking that string will get you in the chair . <h> Volunteer <p> While not directly related to writing , volunteering gets you out of the house , off your butt , and exposes you to people and events that might provide fodder for your work . And it does something good for others , which is good for your soul . You can also volunteer for causes that are writing-related . Maybe tutor disadvantaged youths or help in a literacy campaign . <h> Create Your Online Presence ( or improve what you 've got ) <p> Working writers need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with promotion to connect with readers and clients . If you 've already got something , check to make sure it meets your needs and is professional-looking . If you do n't  have anything , either figure out how to do it yourself or hire someone . Your website does n't  have to be huge or technologically advanced , but it should be professional and informative . <h> Talk Less , Write More <p> Do you find yourself talking about your work more than actually doing it ? If you spend more time talking about how youd like to write , your dreams , and your works in progress , shut up and write . Talking wont get the work done and published . Writing will . <h> Enter a Contest <p> You might not win , but simply entering forces you to produce a work and submit it , helping you to get past the whole , " I 'm afraid of finishing anything and getting rejected " hurdles . And if you do win , fame and fortune might be yours . Or you might just win $20 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Figure out What 's Broken <p> If you 're having trouble even getting to the chair and producing anything , somethings broken . Maybe its your routine . You might be better of writing in the morning rather than in the afternoon or vice versa . Maybe your writers group is n't fun anymore and they 're dragging you down . Maybe you 're feeling negative vibes from your significant other that he or she does n't  like the time you spend writing . Maybe you do n't  like the type of writing you 're doing anymore . Evaluate everything and everybody in your writing life to figure out what 's broken and then figure out how to fix it . <h> Sleep More <p> When you 're well rested , your brain just functions better . You 'll make fewer mistakes in your work and your ideas will be clearer and more numerous . Its hard to get more sleep when you have other things to do , but you simply have to make it a priority . <h> Support Other Writers <p> Most writers wont admit to being jealous of more successful writers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shes so lucky . She only got published because she knew someone who knew someone , " and seething over her good fortune , try being more positive . Try , " Hey , its great that you got published . I 'm so happy for you . " Success for one person does n't  mean there will be none for you . Its not like grabbing the last TV at the Black Friday blowout sale . Be kind and encouraging to others . You might find that you receive support in return instead of negativity . Plus , you 're just gaining good karma points . Who knows ? That person who knew someone who knew someone might share that information with you , too . <h> Learn about Self-Publishing <p> Even if your goal is to be traditionally published , learning about self-publishing can come in handy . Its a growing market with lots of opportunity for all forms of writing . Done well , it can lead to success . Done poorly and hastily , however , and you can end up being the guy with 1,500 one-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Have More Fun <p> If writing is becoming something you dread , you need to find a way to make it fun again . No , its never going to be a laugh-a-minute job , but it should n't be something you hate , either . Maybe you need to try a new form or genre , or just stop taking everything so seriously . <h> Stop Procrastinating <p> There are lots of ways to conquer writers procrastination . Before you let it eat away your productivity , figure out why you do it and then get over it . Every day that you do n't  write is another missed opportunity . This is the easiest way to find more time to write . <h> Conquer Your Fear of Revision <p> Too many writers have bunches of first drafts littering their hard drives , yet they never send them out because revision leaves them cold . The first draft was fun . Revision feels like drudgery . Get over it . Read books or take a class in editing and revision . You can not succeed as a writer unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you beat this fear , the better . <h> Act Professionally ( even if you do n't  feel professional ) <p> This is sort of like faking it till you make it . Even if you do n't  have work or a publisher/agent yet , act as if you do when contacting people . Be confident ( but not arrogant ) and treat everyone with courtesy and professionalism . If you look like a slob , talk in slang , miss deadlines , or submit work with mistakes , people are n't  going to work with you . <h> Limit Non-Essential Internet Surfing <p> The Internet is a fabulous invention , but its also a massive time waster . You can recapture a lot of time in your day if you limit your Facebooking , Tweeting , and mindless surfing . <h> Stay Informed <p> No , you do n't  have to commit to watching two hours of CNN every night . But a good writer is informed , not only about things related to writing but also about world events . Sometimes your best ideas will come from what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself to learning about just one side of an issue . Seek out balanced coverage and form your own opinions . <h> Share <p> Its easy to cocoon yourself in your house with your manuscripts , but you need the input of other people to make your work better . Sure , you think you 're a genius , but what do other people think ? Sharing is scary , though , because it feels risky . " What if they hate it ? Ill have wasted all this time . " Get past the fear . Find people you trust to give you good ( not necessarily positive ) feedback and share your work with them . You 'll get a more realistic picture of how you 're doing . <h> Stop Comparing Yourself to Others <p> Some people make a boatload of money . Others make a more modest amount . Some writers are on TV all the time while others are virtual recluses . No one way is right for everyone , so stop wasting time comparing your career with everyone elses . Every career moves at its own pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Figure out what you want and then go for that , not what you think everyone else is doing . <h> Improve Your Vocabulary <p> You do n't  have to tackle everything on this list . That would ensure failure before you even get the holiday decorations packed away . Just pick one or two that motivate you and then pace yourself so that you spread the effort out over the year . Its a New Years resolution , after all . Its supposed to be good for the whole year so there 's no need to freak out if you have n't finished it by Valentines Day . <p> For many people , one of the most difficult aspects of writing is the proofreading process . If you have been working on a paper or a writing assignment for a long period of time , its easy to read words into your writing that are n't  there and accidentally miss grammatical mistakes within the writing . One of the best ways to prevent this is to get someone to proofread your writing , since they look at it from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that there often is n't someone around who 's willing or able to proofread your writing . If you find you often miss mistakes when proofreading and cant get someone else to proofread it , there are a few steps you can take which will give you a better chance of catching your writing errors . <h> Walk Away <p> One of the best steps you can take when proofreading your own work is to take some time away from it , even if that is only for an hour or two . A full day or two is even better and one of the reasons you should learn to not procrastinate . When you try to proofread as soon as you finish writing , you still have it in your head what you meant to say , and this can often overwrite what 's actually on the pages . Taking some time away will allow you to read your writing with " fresh eyes " and- will make it much more likely you 'll spot errors . <h> Listen to Your Text <p> If you do n't  have time to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing instead of reading it ( you can use the proofread tool available on wordcounter ) . Switching things up so you listen to what you wrote instead of reading it will again will make it more likely you will catch your mistakes rather than if you reread the text . <h> Print and Read <p> Another way to increase the chances of catching mistakes is to print out your writing instead of proofreading it on the computer . Trying to proofread on your computer makes it easier to miss mistakes than when you proofread with the writing physically in front of you . <h> Read from Bottom to Top <p> An effective way of proofreading which- forces you to look at the writing from a different perspective is to proofread from the bottom to the top . Instead of proofreading as one would normally read the writing , start at the bottom and read towards the top . It wo n't make any sense , but that 's the point . It will force you to look at the individual words written , rather than skimming over sentences . <h> Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding mistakes when proofreading is to read your writing out loud instead of silently in your mind . Reading silently increases your chances of inserting skipped words that are n't  on the paper but you meant to write . Audibly saying the words makes it much more difficult to skip over these types of mistakes . <h> Do n't  Do Everything at Once <p> When you do sit down to proofread , do n't  try to correct all the problems in a single read through . Instead , concentrate on a specific aspect you want to make sure is correct . For example , concentrate on word choice for the first read through . Then concentrate on finding grammatical errors and sentence structure mistakes on the second read through . For the third reading , look specifically for spelling mistakes . Yes , this means you are going to have to read through your writing several times instead of a single time , but that will also make it much more likely you 'll find all the mistakes you may have made . <h> Use Spellcheck and GrammarCheck <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been repeated , words which have reversed letters and other common spelling mistakes , but you should never rely on it as the only proofreading you do . While a spell checker is great for its specific job , it fails at a lot of other things , especially when it comes to grammar . " There " is spelled correctly , but its still wrong if the proper word for a sentence is " their . " A grammar check can help out with these mistakes . Both are tools which can help you find errors- you may- miss on your own , but they do n't  replace actually rereading your writing and looking for mistakes . <h> Make a Proofreading Checklist <p> You know your weaknesses better than anyone else , and you should make a checklist of these weaknesses . This will allow you to double and triple check these areas of your writing when you proofread . If you do n't  currently know your writing weaknesses , begin to pay attention to the remarks when you get assignments back so you can create the checklist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be weakest , you 'll improve and make sure you are n't  consistently making the same writing mistakes on your papers . <p> When you have an essay assignment with a minimum word count , one of the worst feelings is when you believe you have finished only to find that you 're still well below the minimum you have to reach ( as opposed to having too many words ) . Many students try to solve this problem by rewriting the essays sentences to make them wordier or splitting contractions . While these do increase word count , they usually make the essay weaker in the process . It does n't  have to be that way . If you ever find yourself in a position where you need to increase the number of words for an essay , below are some simple techniques which can help you add to your writing while improving it instead of writing unneeded filler . <h> Add Examples <p> Skim through your essay looking for any place you have used an example to make a point . In most cases , you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger by showing your understanding of the topic while also increasing the word count . You can also go through the essay and look for statements made where inserting an example would be appropriate to help support the statement . <h> Address Different Viewpoints <p> An effective way of increasing word count and improving your essay at the same time is to address different viewpoints to your own . You have the opportunity to discuss how these alternative viewpoints differ from the conclusions you have made , and it gives you an opportunity to explain why you believe your conclusions are superior . This shows you have considered a range of different opinions while coming to your conclusions , and in doing so make your essay stronger while adding more words . <h> Clarify Statements <p> When you find the statements in your writing , if inserting an example does n't  make sense , then clarifying the statement may be appropriate . This can be achieved by inserting one or more specific statements to clarify the original one . A common way to do this is to follow the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over-clarify statements or use this for every statement you write as it will begin to look like filler , but using it sporadically throughout your essay can increase the word count and show you perfectly understand the points you 're trying to make . <h> Find Additional Sources <p> Another way to improve your essay and increase word count is to find additional sources you have n't previously mentioned which support the statements and conclusions you have made . The more sources you have , the stronger the essay will be in most cases . Spending some time searching for additional sources to add to the essay can be a great way to add quality content to it . <h> Use Quotations <p> Chances are you already have appropriate quotations in your essay , and if that 's the case , skip over this suggestion . Adding more will likely not add to your essay . If you have n't used any , however , finding appropriate quotations from experts in the field that support your statements can be an excellent way to add words to your essay while improving it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the above havent enabled you to reach your word count minimum and you need some filler , look to put it in your introduction and conclusion rather than the body of the essay . Most teachers give more leeway with the introduction and conclusion to be wordy than the guts of the essay . This is something you should try to avoid if at all possible ( its never good to be wordier than you have to be ) , but if you tried everything else , its better to do it in these two places than in the heart of the essay . <h> Page Count <p> If you 're writing an essay which has a minimum page count instead of a minimum word count , the above suggestions will work , but you have a bit more wiggle room as well . You can make slight adjustments to the font and font size you use through a Words per Page Counter . As long as you do n't  go overboard , this can be a relatively easy way to increase page count while not taking away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of words in the Bible , its not as straightforward as it might first appear . The problem is there are hundreds of different translations of the Bible , and each one has a different number of words , so the answer depends on which bible you 're actually referring to . That being said , if you are looking for a general answer , its probably best to use one of the most common versions , such as the King James Bible . <h> How many words are there in the Bible ? <p> The King James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . How many words is that ? If you can type at 60 words a minute , it would take you just over 217 and a half hours to retype the entire Bible . Can you imagine how long type-setting must have taken in the early days of printing ? <p> As for the number of letter characters in the Bible , the total count is a staggering 3,116,480 . Small wonder that in the days of movable type a lot of printing errors were made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not " was accidentally omitted from the commandment " Thou shalt not commit adultery . " Three little letters can make a huge difference in meaning . <p> While 783,137 words and 3,116,480 may seem to be a lot , there are others with even more . The Catholic Bible has an even higher word count because it has seven books more than the protestant Bible . Are you wondering why ? <p> Martin Luther felt that seven of the books accepted as part of the Old Testament at the time were not quite up to scratch since the 90 AD Jewish Council of Jamnia had rejected them . Luther reasoned that the Old Testament was Jewish , and , therefore , shouldnt include anything that Jews did n't  accept . <h> Chapters and verses : finding your way around <p> There are 66 books in the Bible , and before the 12th century , they werent divided into chapters . This innovation was brought about by a man named Stephen Langton , and it made finding your way around a lot easier . All in all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to get " on the same page " when studying the Bible . So in 1551 , Robert Estienne came up with the idea of numbering verses . There are 31,102 of them , and the shortest one is John 11:35 " Jesus wept , " while the longest is in the book of Esther and consists of 78 words . <h> What 's in a name ? <p> A lot of the names we give to children have biblical origins . How many people named " Mark " or " John " do you know ? Now think of all the " Marys " you 've met in your time . Of course , some names have fallen out of grace for good reasons . Being called " Judas " would be a bad start in life for any boy . " Mahershalalhashbaz " is the longest name in the Bible , and fortunately for us , it has fallen out of fashion . <h> Some more wordy facts for fun <p> There are , of course , only 10 commandments which Jesus neatly summed up into two really comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youd come up with a total of 6,468 . Is anyone in the mood for checking this fact ? There are even more predictions 8,000 of them and a sum total of 1,260 promises . <p> Questions are certainly asked . If you were to flip through your Bible counting question marks , youd find 3,294 , but now that I 've told you how many there are , you can save yourself the trouble . <p> The Bible has one Central Character , who is referred to as " God " 4,094 times and as " Lord " 6,781 times . <p> Looking for the longest book in the Bible ? Look no further than Psalms , a book that also includes the longest chapter in the Bible : Psalm 119 , which has more words than any other chapter . For those who are looking for a lot of information in a very short book , 3 John is recommended reading ; it has the lowest word count of all the books in the Bible . <h> So who wrote all this in the first place ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you would like to find out how many human authors were involved , you will find that there is some debate as to who actually wrote what . In general , authorities believe that the Bible was written by 80 authors . <h> How many copies of the Bible have been printed ? <p> Nobody really knows the answer to this question , but the Bible Society estimates that since 1812 , over 5 billion Bibles have been printed . Other experts differ , but one thing is for certain , saying that " a lot " of bibles have been printed over the years would be an understatement . <p> Would you like to guess which country prints the most bibles ? China comes in at number 1 . There 's only one publishing house that 's allowed to print them , and in 2012 , its 100 millionth Bible rolled off the presses . <h> A remarkable book <p> No other book in history has been as influential as the Bible . From its fascinating history to the debates around biblical matters that rage today . Whatever your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Authorized Bible has 783,137 words . <p> There 's often a lot of confusion , but if you 're looking for a general answer to the question , " How many sentences in a paragraph ? " the answer is there are 3 to 8 sentences in a paragraph . The important key to take away from this answer is that its a rule-of-thumb . If you 're looking for a hard and fast rule , you 're out of luck . A paragraph can consist of a single sentence , and since a single word can be a sentence , you can literally have a paragraph that consists of a single word . Of course , if someone asks you to write a paragraph , they wont be altogether happy with that , so how much should you write ? <h> What do teachers want to see in a paragraph ? <p> If you 're a student , your teacher or tutor may ask you to write a paragraph without telling you just how long he or she expects it to be . In general , educators like to see a paragraph consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expresses an idea . Use the next 3 sentences for providing information that supports that idea , and use the final sentence to draw a conclusion . <p> Why do teachers expect longer paragraphs ? Obviously , they want to see that you have acquired knowledge and can think critically . That 's quite difficult- to demonstrate with a single sentence ! Teachers will sometimes set a rule that all paragraphs should be a certain length , but its important to remember that specific paragraph lengths are n't  a prerequisite for acceptable writing . <h> When do you use shorter paragraphs ? <p> Open just about any book , and you 'll find plenty of short paragraphs . If direct speech is used , therell be a new paragraph every time a new speaker starts to talk . News writers also like using short paragraphs . They have to present information in a succinct way and hold the readers attention . <p> Commercial writers know that most people do n't  want to read 1,000 words of closely-spaced text in order to see what they are writing about , so they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use lots of sub-headers so you can see what each paragraph is about before you read it . <h> How do I know when to start a new paragraph ? <p> Every time you begin- to discuss a new thought that contributes to the overarching theme of your work , you can start- a new paragraph . A paragraph will usually consist of a collection of sentences that , when considered as a group , have something in common . As soon as you move on to the next idea , you can begin a new paragraph . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to agonise about it too much , because as I 've pointed out , there are no specific rules . <h> Tips for writing strong paragraphs <p> Its best to begin a paragraph with a sentence that defines the topic that will be discussed . Try to keep it fairly simple . If you include too many ideas in your opening sentence , you run the risk of getting tangled in an overly complex and incoherent paragraph . Every sentence in a paragraph should support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing a new or related topic , start a new paragraph . <p> The University of North Carolina helps students with paragraph construction by providing them with a 5-step process : <p> Express the idea that the paragraph will cover in a topic sentence . <p> Explain the idea . <p> Use an example . <p> Explain why the example relates to the idea . <p> Draw a conclusion . <p> Obviously , the recipe has been designed for those who want to write an informative and convincing work . And because these rules are n't  really cast in stone , you 'll find that different institutions give different recommendations . <h> The debate continues <p> If we look around , well find that the idea of paragraphs with a minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common . But there are some who say that two to three paragraphs per page are best and others who say that 5 to 7 lines will do the job . Meanwhile , journalism students are taught to keep sentences as short as possible , and one sentence paragraphs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that using more than one paragraph to discuss an idea is perfectly alright , and since there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs , I cant really contradict them . I even found one recommendation that suggested a minimum of 7-10 sentences per paragraph and a maximum of a full page ! <h> How long should your paragraphs be ? <p> Unless you 're busy with academic writing , the length of your paragraphs is up to you . I like shorter paragraphs for informal writing such as this blog post . I like the idea of sticking to one idea per paragraph , and I think that paragraphs make reading and understanding a text a whole lot simpler . Single-sentence paragraphs are great for emphasis . <p> If you are writing to pass a school , college or university course , I recommend you ask your teacher or professor what 's expected of you . Its always better to ask in these situations than to try to guess . This is by far the best way to make sure you tailor your writing to what your teacher expects rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a basketball fan but are n't  too familiar with the Golden State Warriors , you may be a bit confused by their nickname . If you look in the stands at the signs the fans display at Golden State Warrior games or listen to commentators talking about the team , you will soon realize that the team is known as " the Dubs " and the fans as " DubNation . " <h> Why are the Golden State Warriors called the Dubs ? <p> The Warriors are called " the Dubs " in a truncated pronunciation of the " W " of Warriors <p> The Dubs is one of those nicknames or terms that does n't  seem to make much sense when you first hear or see it . In fact , one of the reasons you 're likely reading this article is because you could n't figure out why the Warriors are called that on your own . While it may at first appear strange , once you realize where it comes from , it makes a lot more sense . <p> The nickname began in the 1990s when younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the team . Instead of pronouncing the teams full name , some fans began to refer to the team as the " Ws " . " W " soon was changed from its proper pronunciation to " dub-a-u , " which then was further shortened to just " dub . " As the team became more popular with the younger generation using this slang to describe the team , the term caught on with the general public , and the team began to refer to themselves in this manner as well . So while The Dubs may seem a little strange at first , its simply a shortening of the team name " Warriors " over time . <h> Why are the Warriors fans called Dub Nation ? <p> Dub Nation is how fans refer to themselves as a collective whole . If you 're a Golden State Warriors fan , then you are part of the Dub Nation . Since it was the fans who originally came up with the nickname of the Dubs for the Warriors , they also began to call themselves by the same term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the fans use the same abbreviation for " Warriors " and began to call themselves the " Dub Nation . " <h> Why are the Warriors called the doves ? <p> The Warriors and their fans do n't  refer to themselves as the doves , although people thinking they call themselves " the doves " is a common misconception . The reason this happens is n't too difficult to surmise . Since there is a similar pronunciation between the words " Dub " and " Dove , " it makes sense that the two words could get mixed up . This is especially true sine " Dub " is n't a normal word in the English language , so many people likely mishear it as the closest real word they know , which happens to be " dove . " <h> Why are the Warriors called The City ? <p> When the Warriors first moved to the west coast in 1962 , the were located in San Francisco and were called the San Francisco Warriors . " The City " logo was created in the years before they moved across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The City " refers to San Francisco even though the Warriors currently are located in Oakland ( but will be moving to a new stadium there soon ) . <p> " The City " logo uniforms were brought back in the mid-2000s as a throwback uniform . Theyre iconic for the area , look good , and most importantly , sell well as merchandise . Since they are one of the most popular logos for fans , the Warriors use this throwback uniform on a regular basis these days . <h> Why do the Warriors rub their arms ? <p> The Golden State Warriors have a unique 3-point celebration . If you watch the Warriors bench ( and now many of the fans in the crowd as well ) you will often see them make a 3-point gesture that might not make sense at first sight . The bench ( and crowd ) will stand up and point their arm toward the sky making an " okay " sign ( thumb and pointer finger in a circle with the other three fingers sticking out ) , then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down along the outstretched arm . <p> The gesture is supposed to represent a shotgun being fired and then reloaded . Its the teams way of showing approval toward the 3-point shooting ability of their teammates , and acknowledging that the players are " locked and loaded " and ready to score . The gesture originated on the warriors bench from Shaun Livingston , who brought it with him when he joined the Warriors . It stuck , and it now can be seen many times throughout most Warriors games . <p> Whether you want to do a word count or a character count , it helps to know the number of letters in the alphabet . Knowing the correct number of letters in the alphabet depends greatly on which languages alphabet you are referring to . While many may assume you 're talking about English , that might not always be the best assumption since there are so many different languages around the world . Below are the answers to this question for some of the more popular world languages . <h> How many letters are there in the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabet which range from a to z ( with b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t , u , v , w , x , and y in between ) . What many people do n't  know is as recently as 200 years ago , there used to be 27 letters in the English alphabet . While many probably are familiar with the number of letters in English ( if they are native English speakers ) , they may not be quite as familiar with the numbers in other languages . <h> How many letters are there in the Arabic alphabet ? <p> Those curly letters do look pretty , and there are 28 letters in Arabic just two more than the English alphabet . Sounds simple ? Perhaps not as simple as it looks ! All 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet are consonants . <p> That 's not to say that Arabic does n't  have vowels . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by a " diacritical mark " a glyph that 's added to a consonant . Just to make things more confusing , you wo n't always bother with vowels . Theyre essential if you 're quoting the Quran or if you 're writing a book for children , but most of the time , you just leave them out . <h> How many letters are there in the Chinese alphabet ? <p> Now things get really complicated ! If you want to have functional literacy in Chinese , you " only " need to know three or four thousand characters . And I say " only " because there are literally tens of thousands of Chinese characters . <p> That 's because Chinese does n't  actually have an alphabet at all . Instead of the marks you make representing sounds , they represent ideas ( ideograms ) or pictures ( pictograms ) . And of course , you can combine ideas and get compound pictograms . So the word " good " is represented by the ideogram for " woman " and the ideogram for " child " superimposed on one another . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To read Japanese , you 'll need to know about 2,000 symbols from three " alphabets . " The first of these is known as " kanji , " and it consists of pictograms that originated in China . Then there are two phonetic alphabets , " hiragana " and " katakana . " At least these two alphabets actually represent sounds , so they are easier for a foreigner to learn and understand . Both hiragana and katakana have 46 letters . <h> How many letters are there in the Korean alphabet ? <p> Westerners may heave a sigh of relief when they hear that the Korean alphabet , known as the Hangul in the South and the Chosangul in the North , consists of 24 characters and there are vowels too . However , we may have some difficulty piecing together some Korean writing , because Korean characters are arranged in blocks that become syllables . So what looks like a single character to us , may be a combination of characters representing a sound . <h> How many letters are there in the Russian alphabet ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alphabet consisting of 33 letters . 10 of these are vowels , 21 are consonants and there are two additional " signs " to learn . Luckily , Russian is a phonetic language , so you can learn what sounds each letter represents and take it from there . <h> How many letters are there in the Spanish alphabet ? <p> English speakers will feel as if they 're on some familiar ground with the Spanish alphabet but be warned there are actually 29 letters in the Spanish alphabet . The extra four are ch , ll , + and rr , each of which represents a different sound . And while were talking about sounds , " h " may be vital to spelling , but its a silent letter . <h> How many letters are there in the Italian alphabet ? <p> Although Italian may not be the easiest language in the world if you take grammar into account , the alphabet is a breeze . It only has 21 letters . " Foreign " letters : j , k , w , x and y are borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to learn a few spelling rules before you can join a spelling bee . <h> How many letters are there in the Greek alphabet ? <p> From Alpha to Omega , were looking at 24 letters in the Greek alphabet . Greek is one of the oldest scripts still in use , and its one of the roots of Latin script that determines how we write today . Once one gets used to the different-looking letters and how they should sound , there should be few problems reading Greek even without understanding it . Its a phonetic language with few tricky vices to throw you off . <h> How many letters are there in the German alphabet ? <p> Despite some formatting differences and the presence of the umlaut , which has different effects on pronunciation depending on where you put it , the German alphabet has the 26 letters that English speakers are used to . Of course , learning an alphabet and learning a language are two different things . Reading German is n't all that difficult once you have some vocabulary , but becoming fluent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things that everyone understands <p> Its important to remember that alphabets are n't  everything when it comes to communication . You do n't  have to be a linguist to smile , something everyone understands . The game of charades , which is often the foreigners last resort when verbal communication fails , can also get you through some tight spots . It may not always be effective , but even when it is n't , it usually provokes hilarity at the very least . <p> The Harry Potter books are popular , and once someone reads the first book in the series , they often end up reading the entire series . What is n't often considered is the sheer number of words a person who reads the entire series consumes . For those who like to keep track of their reading word count or those who want to encourage their kids to read more the Harry Potter books series is an excellent way to do so . <p> So , how many total words are there in the Harry Potter series ?

The book with the least total number of words is Sorcerers Stones , while the book with the most words is Order of the Phoenix . Only 2 of the 7 Harry Potter books came in at under 100,000 words ( Sorcerers Stones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two books in the series .

Now you know you can congratulate anyone who has read all the Harry Potter books of reading more than a million words . <h> 10 Surprising Facts About Harry Potter <p> For anyone who has taken the time to manually count the number of words on a page of paper , you know its both time consuming and frustrating . There has to be a better way . Fortunately , word counters can easily give you the information for your own writing , but what if you need to know the exact number of words for a particular page ? Getting this information is a bit more difficult . <p> There could be a number of reasons you want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its because you have an assignment which requires you to write a certain number of pages , so youd like to know how many words are needed to fill a page . The problem is there 's not a definitive answer to this questions because there are so many factors that go into calculating the number of words on a page . <p> For those looking for a general rule of thumb , you can estimate that there are about 250 words on a page double spaced , or 500 words on a page single spaced . This is a rough estimate and the true number of words on the page is likely to be more or less . This may not be a big factor for the single page , but if you are estimating for a lot of pages , the actual number can be significantly different than the estimated number . <p> If you know some basics about the writing and the page , you can get a much more accurate estimate by using a Words per Page calculator . This will allow you to input the font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courier , Times New Roman or Verdana ) , the font size , and whether the page is single or doubled spaced . Using this information and the number of words , the calculator can give a more accurate estimate than using the rule-of-thumb estimate . You also have the option of using the " type your own Words " function to get the estimated number of pages for your writing . <p> Another reason you may be searching for how many words there are on a page is you may want to know the number of words for a particular page on the Internet . Since web pages are n't  limited to the size of a standard sheet of paper , the actual number of words on the page can vary wildly , and are often much larger than a typical paper page . In cases like this , you can use a Website Page Word Count calculator . <p> To find out this word count information , you simply input the URL of the websites page for which you need to know the number of words and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular page . Even better , it will also give you a list of the words used on the page including how many times each word is used . <p> One of the many Word Counter features writers often find useful is " Keyword Density .
